monkeypox_corpus = ["Between 7 and 25 May, 86 monkeypox cases were confirmed in the United Kingdom (UK). Only one case is known to have travelled to a monkeypox virus (MPXV) endemic country. Seventy-nine cases with information were male and 66 reported being gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men. This is the first reported sustained MPXV transmission in the UK, with human-to-human transmission through close contacts, including in sexual networks. Improving case ascertainment and onward-transmission preventive measures are ongoing.", "On 22 June, a man who returned to South Korea from Germany tested positive for the monkeypox virus using real-time polymerase chain reaction. We identified 49 contacts concerning the first monkeypox case and classified them into two groups based on risk exposure levels. Through active monitoring of eight people in the medium-risk group and passive monitoring of 41 people in the low-risk group, we identified that no secondary transmission occurred over 21 days. The prompt active or passive monitoring of the index case of imported monkeypox could prevent community transmission in Korea.", "In June 2022, the first monkeypox case was reported as imported into Korea. The general public asked whether they should get vaccinated against monkeypox because of the recent COVID-19 vaccination experience. As of the current monkeypox outbreak situation, a ring vaccination strategy for the high-risk group is more appropriate than the mass population vaccination with smallpox vaccines. Therefore, identifying the proper target group by available vaccines based on the risk and benefit analysis is a key issue of the vaccination program. In addition, the target group should be reviewed by the epidemiological situation of the jurisdiction along with the updated evidence of the monkeypox virus on transmission dynamics, severity, and fatality.", "Since May 2022, an outbreak of monkeypox has been ongoing in non-endemic countries. We report four cases in Italy in young adult men reporting condomless sexual intercourse. The patients are in good clinical condition with no need for specific antiviral drugs. Biological samples from seminal fluid were positive for monkeypox viral DNA. For many other viruses found in semen there is no evidence of sexual transmission. The possibility of sexual transmission of monkeypox virus needs to be investigated.", "The reemergence of monkeypox virus in the twenty-first century, calls for an urgency in its control and preventive measures. There is a long-standing concern that the reemergence of monkeypox across countries could lead to another epidemic like the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the disease ecology, preventing its transmission could help curbing its spread. The established treatment protocols along with development of new antiviral agents and vaccines could play a pivotal role in controlling its transmission.In this review, we summarize the different modes of transmission of this disease, the associated symptoms, the standard protocol of treatment, the available vaccines and use of alternative treatments. We have collated recent research on novel entities that could potentially treat monkeypox infection.The One Health approach fostered by the World Health Organization (WHO) for emergent and reemerging zoonotic diseases has to be implemented with a view to curb their transmission. The growing global population and increased inter-country travel has led to rapid spread of transmissible pathogens. Stigmatization, associated with lack of knowledge can be prevented by enhancing awareness campaigns. Vaccines need to be administered to high-risk individuals, and drug discovery efforts need to be intensified to combat such diseases.", "Monkeypox is an emerging viral disease that has been declared a global health emergency. While this disease has been present for over 50 years, the recent surge in cases and expanding knowledge of this has prompted a need for a focused review for practicing clinicians.This narrative review provides a focused overview of the epidemiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of monkeypox for emergency clinicians.Monkeypox is an orthopoxvirus endemic to central and western Africa. An outbreak in May and June 2022 across Asia, Europe, North America, and South America was declared a global health emergency in July 2022. The disease can be transmitted via contact with an infected animal or human, as well as contact with a contaminated material. The disease presents with a prodromal flu-like illness and lymphadenopathy. A rash spreading in a centrifugal manner involving the oral mucosa, face, palms, and soles is typical. Lesions progress along various stages. Complications such as bacterial skin infection, pneumonitis, ocular conditions, and encephalitis are uncommon. Confirmation typically includes polymerase chain reaction testing. The majority of patients improve with symptomatic therapy, and as of July 2022, there are no United States Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments specifically for monkeypox. However, antiviral treatment should be considered for several patient populations at risk for severe outcomes.An understanding of the presentation, evaluation, and management of monkeypox is essential for emergency clinicians to ensure appropriate diagnosis and treatment of this emerging disease.", "Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is closely related to the infamous variola (smallpox) virus, causing a febrile rash illness in humans similar to but milder than smallpox. In the twentieth century, human monkeypox had been mostly a rare zoonotic disease confined to forested areas in West and Central Africa. However, the case number and geographic range have increased significantly in this century, coincided with the waning of the smallpox vaccine-induced immunity in the global population. The outbreak of human monkeypox in multiple countries since May 2022 has been unusual in its large case number and the absence of direct links to endemic countries, raising concerns for a possible change in monkeypox transmission pattern that could pose a greater global threat. Here, we review aspects of MPXV biology that are relevant for risk assessment and preparedness for a monkeypox epidemic, with an emphasis on recent progress in understanding of the virus host range, evolutionary potential, and neutralization targets.", "As of October 21, 2022, a total of 27,884 monkeypox cases (confirmed and probable) have been reported in the United States.<sup>\u00a7</sup> Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men have constituted a majority of cases, and persons with HIV infection and those from racial and ethnic minority groups have been disproportionately affected (1,2). During previous monkeypox outbreaks, severe manifestations of disease and poor outcomes have been reported among persons with HIV infection, particularly those with AIDS (3-5). This report summarizes findings from CDC clinical consultations provided for 57 patients aged \u226518 years who were hospitalized with severe manifestations of monkeypox<sup>\u00b6</sup> during August 10-October 10, 2022, and highlights three clinically representative cases. Overall, 47 (82%) patients had HIV infection, four (9%) of whom were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) before monkeypox diagnosis. Most patients were male (95%) and 68% were non-Hispanic Black (Black). Overall, 17 (30%) patients received intensive care unit (ICU)-level care, and 12 (21%) have died. As of this report, monkeypox was a cause of death or contributing factor in five of these deaths; six deaths remain under investigation to determine whether monkeypox was a causal or contributing factor; and in one death, monkeypox was not a cause or contributing factor.** Health care providers and public health professionals should be aware that severe morbidity and mortality associated with monkeypox have been observed during the current outbreak in the United States (6,7), particularly among highly immunocompromised persons. Providers should test all sexually active patients with suspected monkeypox for HIV at the time of monkeypox testing unless a patient is already known to have HIV infection. Providers should consider early commencement and extended duration of monkeypox-directed therapy<sup>\u2020\u2020</sup> in highly immunocompromised patients with suspected or laboratory-diagnosed monkeypox.<sup>\u00a7\u00a7</sup> Engaging all persons with HIV in sustained care remains a critical public health priority.", "The recent outbreak of Human Monkeypox (MPXV) in nonendemic regions of the world is of great concern.We aimed to systematically analyze the current epidemiology, clinical presentation, and outcomes of the Monkeypox virus.Systematic literature was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, and Scopus using predefined MESH terms by using \"AND\" and \"OR.\" The following search terms were used: Monkeypox [MeSH] OR \"Monkeypox virus\" [MeSH] OR \"POX\" OR \"Monkeypox\" AND \"Outbreak\" AND \"Outcomes\" from December 2019 till 14th June 2022 without restrictions of language.A total of 1074 (99.90%) patients tested positive for Monkeypox virus through RT-PCR while 1 (0.09) patient was suspected. There was a gender difference with male predominance (54.23% vs. 45.48%) compared with female patients. Mean age (\u00b1SD) of patients was 20.66\u2009\u00b1\u200916.45 years. The major symptoms were rash (100%), fever (96%), and other important symptoms were upper respiratory symptoms (97%), headache (95%), vomiting (95%), oral ulcers (96%), conjunctivitis (96%) and lymphadenopathy (85%). The average mean duration of treatment was 5 days, while the mean hospitalization duration was 13.3\u2009\u00b1\u20096.37 days. The outcome of 20 patients was available, 19 of 20 patients recovered fully from monkeypox, however, 1 patient was not able to survive resulting in death.The recent monkeypox virus outbreak has shown that the virus could transmit in ways that were not previously expected. Further research is needed to understand the possible outcomes and association with humans and their different organ systems.", "The current monkeypox outbreak reawakens the concern that poxviridae have a high potential for zoonotic spillover and causing a pandemic. Much fieldwork and research have been done by health care and public health workers in Africa during previous human outbreaks, and their knowledge should inform our global response to the current outbreak. However, unusual clinical presentations now have potential implications for recognizing the disease. In addition, infections from poxviridae, such as monkeypox, have common cutaneous signs that occur early, may be related to periods of transmissibility, and can leave scarring. Therefore, dermatologists will play a key role in recognizing and diagnosing infections and educating and preparing frontline health care workers for the early detection of new cases and clusters of monkeypox.", "Monkeypox virus is the causative agent of monkeypox disease, belonging to an orthopoxvirus genus, with a disease pattern similar to that of smallpox. The number of monkeypox cases have robustly increased recently in several countries around the world, potentially causing an international threat. Therefore, serious measures are indispensable to be taken to mitigate the spread of the disease and hence, under these circumstances, vaccination is the best choice to neutralize the monkeypox virus. In the current study, we used immunoinformatic approaches to target the L1R, B5R, and A33R proteins of the monkeypox virus to screen for immunogenic cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL), helper T-lymphocyte (HTL), and B-cell epitopes to construct multiepitope subunit vaccines. Various online tools predicted the best epitope from immunogenic targets (L1R, B5R, and A33R) of monkeypox virus. The predicted epitopes were joined together by different linkers and subjected to 3D structure prediction. Molecular dynamics simulation analysis confirmed the proper folding of the modeled proteins. The strong binding of the constructed vaccines with human TLR-2 was verified by the molecular docking and determination of dissociation constant values. The GC content and codon adaptation index (CAI) values confirmed the high expression of the constructed vaccines in the pET-28a (+) expression vector. The immune response simulation data delineated that the injected vaccines robustly activated the immune system, triggering the production of high titers of IgG and IgM antibodies. In conclusion, this study provided a solid base of concept to develop dynamic and effective vaccines that contain several monkeypox virus-derived highly antigenic and nonallergenic peptides to control the current pandemic of monkeypox virus.", "As the world continues to endure the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, an outbreak of Monkeypox occurs and continues to spread unabatedly. The double-stranded DNA monkeypox virus is a sylvatic zoonosis, which occasionally infects humans and is a member of the genus Orthopoxviruses. Although scientists believed the virus to have low transmissibility, the speed and degree with which it spreads is alarming and could land one in a hospital or even kill one. Additionally, the fact that unusual transmissions are occurring among people without travel history to endemic regions suggests undetected transmissions, raising concerns about our preparedness for another pandemic. Contrary to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a vaccine that could offer some protection against the monkeypox virus. Therefore, there is a need for coordinated efforts among authorities concerned and community-based organizations to raise awareness of the potential pandemic of monkeypox, activate surveillance systems and laboratory capacity, and heighten contact tracing and vaccination of at-risk individuals to stem the outbreak while there is still the opportunity to prevent it from becoming a pandemic.", "Rapid diagnosis is key to containing viral outbreaks. However, for the current monkeypox outbreak the major deterrent to rapid testing is the requirement for higher biocontainment of potentially infectious monkeypox virus specimens. The current CDC guidelines require the DNA extraction process before PCR amplification to be performed under biosafety level 3 unless vaccinated personnel are performing assays. This increases the turn-around time and makes certain laboratories insufficiently equipped to handle specimens from patients with suspected monkeypox infection. We investigated the ability of five commercially available lysis buffers and heat for inactivation of monkeypox virus. We also optimized the use of monkeypox virus in Hologic<sup>\u00ae</sup> Panther Specimen Lysis Buffer for detection of virus in the Panther Fusion<sup>\u00ae</sup> Open Access System using published generic and clade specific monkeypox virus primers and probes.", "<i>Background and Objectives</i>: With more and more cases emerging outside central and west African countries, where the disease is endemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recently declared human monkeypox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Typical symptoms of the disease include fever, myalgia, and lymphadenopathy followed by a rash, but other symptoms may occur. Immunocompromised patients, including patients with uncontrolled Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, may be at risk for more severe courses. <i>Case presentation:</i> We present the case of a 30-year-old male patient of Brazilian descent with monkeypox. Initial symptoms were fever and general discomfort, with painful pharyngitis and tonsillitis and finally a papular rash of the anogenital area as the disease progressed. The presumed date of infection was a sexual contact with an unknown male eight days before the first symptoms occurred. The patient had a known and controlled HIV infection. The main reason for the initial presentation at the hospital was painful pharyngitis and tonsillitis, limiting food intake. Monkeypox infection was confirmed via PCR testing from a swab sample of cutaneous lesions. Adequate systemic and local analgesia enabled oral food uptake again. Antiviral therapy with Tecovirimat was not administered due to the stable immune status of the patient and the mild clinical symptoms. To cover a possible bacterial superinfection or Syphilis infection of the tonsil, antibiotic therapy with Ceftriaxone was added. Several days after presentation, the inflammation of the pharynx resolved and was followed by non-painful mucosal peeling. The patient was followed up with telephone calls and reported a complete recovery. The skin lesions were completely dried out 18 days after the first symptoms. <i>Conclusions:</i> Painful pharyngitis and tonsillitis can be rare early symptoms of monkeypox, which is highly relevant in everyday clinical practice. Particularly in patients with risk factors for monkeypox infection, further clinical and microbiologic testing for monkeypox should be performed if there is a clinical presentation with pharyngitis and tonsillitis.", "Monkeypox virus (MPXV), genetic closely linked to the notorious variola (smallpox) virus, currently causes several clusters and outbreaks in the areas outside Africa and is noted to be phylogenetically related to the West African clade. To prepare for the upsurge of the cases of monkeypox in the Europe and North America, two vaccines, Jynneos\u00ae in the U.S. (Imvamune\u00ae in Canada or Imvanex\u00ae in the Europe) and ACAM2000\u00ae (Acambis, Inc.) initially developed in the smallpox eradication program, can provide protective immunity to monkeypox, and their production and availability are rapidly scaled up in the response to the emerging threat. So far, these two vaccines are recommended for people at a high risk for monkeypox, instead of universal vaccination. Tecovirimat, an inhibitor of extracellular virus formation, and brincidofovir, a lipid conjugate of cidofovir, both are in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo active against MPXV, and are suggested for immunocompromised persons, who are at risk to develop severe diseases. However, current general consensus in the response to the monkeypox outbreak among public health systems is early identification and isolation of infected patients to prevent its spread.", "Monkeypox is a zoonotic Orthopoxvirus which has predominantly affected humans living in western and central Africa since the 1970s. Type I and II interferon signaling, NK cell function, and serologic immunity are critical for host immunity against monkeypox. Monkeypox can evade host viral recognition and block interferon signaling, leading to overall case fatality rates of up to 11%. The incidence of monkeypox has increased since cessation of smallpox vaccination. In 2022, a global outbreak emerged, predominantly affecting males, with exclusive human-to-human transmission and more phenotypic variability than earlier outbreaks. Available vaccines are safe and effective tools for prevention of severe disease, but supply is limited. Now considered a public health emergency, more studies are needed to better characterize at-risk populations and to develop new anti-viral therapies.", "As of August 5, 2022, >26,000 cases of monkeypox have been diagnosed worldwide and the steep increase of cases has spurred renewed concern about the risk for another viral pandemic. In this narrative review, we address etiology, epidemiology and virology of monkeypox, describing routes of transmission and modes of spread. We also describe the current clinical presentation of monkeypox, focusing on circumstances where the disease should be suspected, and the methods to diagnose it. Finally, we briefly describe available treatments and strategies for active immune prophylaxis.", "The emergence of the monkeypox outbreak in early 2022 has posed a new global health threat. As of July 8, 2022, 9069 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported, and most of them are from non-endemic countries. The monkeypox virus is an enveloped double-stranded DNA virus, and preliminary genetic data suggest that the 2022 monkeypox virus belongs to the West African clade. In the current outbreak, human-to-human transmission has been the primary transmission mode. Although direct skin-to-skin contact with lesions during sexual activities can spread the virus, it remains unclear whether monkeypox can spread through sexual contact, specifically through contaminated body fluids. The typical presentation of monkeypox includes prodromal symptoms, followed by a rash that usually begins within 1-3 days of symptom onset, and the skin lesions can last for 2-4 weeks and then gradually resolve. However, the monkeypox outbreak in 2022 may exhibit atypical features. A definite diagnosis of monkeypox virus infection requires nucleic acid amplification testing via the polymerase chain reaction method. Supportive care is essential, and antiviral therapy is not considered for all affected patients, but recommended for those at highrisk for severe diseases. The mitigation of monkeypox outbreaks include enhanced case detection, case isolation, contact tracing, and post-exposure vaccination. In conclusion, the current monkeypox outbreak is a new threat during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinicians should be aware of this new situation, which presents a different scenario from those of prior outbreaks. Global health systems should develop effective strategies to mitigate the spread of monkeypox.", "In order to cope with monkeypox in children and adolescents, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released \"Clinical Considerations for Monkeypox in Children and Adolescents\", which is specially written for pediatric health workers serving children and adolescents under the age of 18 years to standardize the clinical management of children and adolescents with exposure to monkeypox (human monkeypox or animal monkeypox) or with suspected or confirmed monkeypox. This document highlights the characteristics of children and adolescents and gives some valuable suggestions to the special issues in pediatric clinical practice, and it is worth studying by pediatric health workers who are preparing for a possible epidemic of monkeypox.", "As of October 11, 2022, a total of 26,577 monkeypox cases had been reported in the United States.* Although most cases of monkeypox are self-limited, lesions that involve anatomically vulnerable sites can cause complications. Ocular monkeypox can occur when Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is introduced into the eye (e.g., from autoinoculation), potentially causing conjunctivitis, blepharitis, keratitis, and loss of vision (1). This report describes five patients who acquired ocular monkeypox during July-September 2022. All patients received treatment with tecovirimat (Tpoxx)<sup>\u2020</sup>; four also received topical trifluridine (Viroptic).<sup>\u00a7</sup> Two patients had HIV-associated immunocompromise and experienced delays between clinical presentation with monkeypox and initiation of monkeypox-directed treatment. Four patients were hospitalized, and one experienced marked vision impairment. To decrease the risk for autoinoculation, persons with monkeypox should be advised to practice hand hygiene and to avoid touching their eyes, which includes refraining from using contact lenses (2). Health care providers and public health practitioners should be aware that ocular monkeypox, although rare, is a sight-threatening condition. Patients with signs and symptoms compatible with ocular monkeypox should be considered for urgent ophthalmologic evaluation and initiation of monkeypox-directed treatment. Public health officials should be promptly notified of cases of ocular monkeypox. Increased clinician awareness of ocular monkeypox and of approaches to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment might reduce associated morbidity.", "Since the eradication of smallpox in 1980, monkeypox has been the most prevalent zoonosis caused by orthopoxviruses. The virus has been largely endemic to the rainforests of Central and West Africa with occasional exportation to other countries. The disease typically runs a self-limited course with case fatality rates ranging from 4 to 11%. Currently, the world is faced with a multi-country outbreak of monkeypox, whose extent and impact remains to be seen.The objective of this article is to discuss the changing epidemiology of the monkeypox virus, with special reference to the current outbreak.Since the beginning of this outbreak which started on May 7th, till 14th of June 2022, a total of 1879 cases of monkeypox have been reported worldwide, spanning across 35 non-endemic, and commonly involving men who have sex with men. The magnitude of this unprecedented outbreak has highlighted the lacunae in our understanding of the viral epidemiology and ecology. What was earlier a rare sporadic zoonotic disease is now an emergent pathogen with documented human-to-human transmission potential, both in household as well as nosocomial settings. Waning immunity due to cessation of smallpox vaccination, wide host range of the virus, undetected circulation in wildlife in pan-geographic areas, emergence of better adapted strains of the virus due to unchecked replication in the HIV positive immunocompromised population along with deforestation and human encroachment of reservoir areas are some of the plausible reasons for an increased incidence of the disease. Unflinching government commitment, healthcare worker training, education of the masses, stockpiling of the available vaccine and drug, intersectoral co-ordination in lines of the One Health approach are simultaneously needed to avert the current spread of monkeypox. There is also a compelling need to strengthen surveillance systems to curb future outbreaks.", "Monkeypox is a viral zoonosis, with symptoms similar to those seen in smallpox patients, although the clinical presentation may be less severe. Until recently, human monkeypox infection was rare, and primarily occurred in Central and West Africa.An international outbreak began in May 2022, and monkeypox has now been detected on every continent except Antarctica. The first recognized case from the current outbreak was confirmed in the United Kingdom on 6 May 2022, in an adult with travel links to Nigeria, but it has been suggested that cases had been spreading in Europe for months. On 23 July 2022 the Director-General of the World Health Organization declared the monkeypox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.There are no treatments specifically for monkeypox virus infections. However, monkeypox and smallpox viruses are genetically similar, and therapeutics developed to combat smallpox may be used to treat monkeypox. This manuscripts reviews what is known about these potential treatments, including tecovirimat and brincidofovir, based on a literature search of PubMed through 9 August 2022, and explores how these therapeutics may be used in the future to address the expanding monkeypox pandemic.", "Monkeypox is caused by a pox virus closely related to smallpox virus and spreads from animals to humans, and humans to humans following close contact. Prior smallpox vaccination gives partial protection against monkeypox. The steady increase in monkeypox cases in Africa over the past few decades were ignored by the global scientific community till this year, when more than 16,000 cases have been reported from nonendemic countries. Monkeypox has recently been labelled as a public health emergency of international concern by the WHO. While most of the current cases are in men who have sex with men, there is the larger threat of the disease spilling into the general population. The disease is characterized by a short febrile illness with lymphadenopathy followed by a rash which spreads centrifugally and passes through phases of macules, papules, vesicles, and pustules. Recovery occurs in most patients within 2-4 wk. Complications are more likely in children, pregnant women, and the immunocompromised. Specific diagnosis is by detection of viral DNA by PCR. Treatment is largely symptomatic. Tecorivimat is a promising antiviral drug. Vaccination with the currently available smallpox vaccines is recommended for high-risk groups, health care workers, and close contacts. Control of the monkeypox outbreak needs a multipronged effort comprising enhanced surveillance, quick diagnosis, isolation of affected people, ring immunization, and adoption of \"one health\" approach.", "Monkeypox 2022 exhibits unprecedented human-to-human transmission and presents with different clinical features than those observed in prior outbreaks. Previously endemic only to West and Central Africa, the monkeypox virus spread rapidly world-wide following confirmation of a case in the United Kingdom on May 7, 2022 of an individual that had traveled to Nigeria. Detection of cases with no travel history confirms on-going community spread. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) professionals will likely encounter patients suspected or confirmed to have monkeypox, previously a rare disease and therefore unfamiliar to most clinicians. Consequently, it is critical for EMS medical directors to immediately implement policies and procedures for EMS teams - including emergency medical dispatchers - to identify potential monkeypox cases. These must include direction on actions EMS professionals should take to protect themselves and others from virus transmission. Monkeypox 2022 may manifest more subtly than it has historically. Presentations include a subclinical prodrome and less dramatic skin lesions - potentially limited to genital or anal body regions - which can be easily confused with dermatologic manifestations of common sexually transmitted infections (STIs). While most readily spread by close contact with infectious skin lesions on a patient, it is also transmissible from fomites, such as bed sheets. Additionally, droplet transmission can occur, and the virus can be spread by aerosolization under certain conditions. The long incubation period could have profound negative consequences on EMS staffing if clinicians are exposed to monkeypox. This report summarizes crucial information needed for EMS professionals to understand and manage the monkeypox 2022 outbreak. It presents an innovative Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool for use by EMS policymakers, educators, and clinicians on the frontlines who may encounter monkeypox patients. Patients are identified as potentially exposed or infected after an initial assessment of risk factors with associated signs and symptoms. Prehospital workers must immediately don personal protective equipment (PPE) and isolate infectious patients. Also, EMS professionals must report exposures to their agency infection control officer and alert health authorities for non-transported patients. Prehospital professionals play a crucial role in emerging and re-emerging infectious disease mitigation. The monkeypox 2022 3I Tool includes knowledge essential for all clinicians, plus specific information to guide critical actions in the prehospital environment.", "High prevalences of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have been reported in the current global monkeypox outbreak, which has affected primarily gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) (1-5). In previous monkeypox outbreaks in Nigeria, concurrent HIV infection was associated with poor monkeypox clinical outcomes (6,7). Monkeypox, HIV, and STI surveillance data from eight U.S. jurisdictions* were matched and analyzed to examine HIV and STI diagnoses among persons with monkeypox and assess differences in monkeypox clinical features according to HIV infection status. Among 1,969 persons with monkeypox during May 17-July 22, 2022, HIV prevalence was 38%, and 41% had received a diagnosis of one or more other reportable STIs in the preceding year. Among persons with monkeypox and diagnosed HIV infection, 94% had received HIV care in the preceding year, and 82% had an HIV viral load of <200 copies/mL, indicating HIV viral suppression. Compared with persons without HIV infection, a higher proportion of persons with HIV infection were hospitalized (8% versus 3%). Persons with HIV infection or STIs are disproportionately represented among persons with monkeypox. It is important that public health officials leverage systems for delivering HIV and STI care and prevention to reduce monkeypox incidence in this population. Consideration should be given to prioritizing persons with HIV infection and STIs for vaccination against monkeypox. HIV and STI screening and other recommended preventive care should be routinely offered to persons evaluated for monkeypox, with linkage to HIV care or HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as appropriate.", "Monkeypox re-emerged in May 2022 as another global health threat. This study assessed the public's perception, worries, and vaccine acceptance for Monkeypox and COVID-19 during the first month of WHO announcement.A large-scale, cross-sectional survey was conducted between May 27 and June 5, 2022, in Saudi Arabia. Data were collected on sociodemographic characteristics, previous infection with COVID-19, worry levels regarding Monkeypox compared to COVID-19, awareness, and perceptions of Monkeypox, and vaccine acceptance.Among the 1546 participants, most respondents (62%) were more worried about COVID-19 than Monkeypox. Respondents aged 45 years and above and those with a university degree or higher had lower odds of agreement with Monkeypox vaccination (OR 0.871, p-value 0.006, OR 0.719, p-value <0.001), respectively. Respondents with moderate to a high level of self and family commitment to infection control precautionary measures and those who expressed self and family worry of Monkeypox infection had significantly higher odds of vaccination agreement (OR 1.089 p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.047, OR1.395 p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.003) respectively. On the other hand, respondents who previously developed COVID-19 were significantly more worried about the Monkeypox disease (1.30 times more, p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.020).Worry levels amongst the public are higher from COVID-19 than Monkeypox. Perception of Monkeypox as a dangerous and virulent disease, worry from contracting the disease, and high commitment to infection precautionary measures were predictors of agreement with Monkeypox vaccination. While advanced age and high education level are predictors of low agreement with vaccination.", "Since the end of June 2022, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of monkeypox cases worldwide. Given the potential spread of this epidemic, WHO has declared the monkeypox epidemic a global public health emergency. In the face of the changing epidemiology during this monkeypox outbreak, vaccines and preventive measures are being researched around the world in response to this emerging disease. Recently, confirmed cases were reported in South Korea and Japan; as connections between countries around the world resume, imported cases may be inevitable. China is also concerned and prepared for the danger approaching Asia. In response to this risk, China issued the \"Monkeypox Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines\" and the General Administration of Customs of China announced that travelers from countries reporting monkeypox cases and with suspected symptoms should be identified to customs upon entry. Chinese researchers have recently generated two pseudovirus reference materials for the monkeypox viral wild-type B6R gene and mutant F3L gene. Moreover, monkeypox as a communicable disease can be added to the current COVID-19 tracking system for better surveillance and management.", "Monkeypox has recently been detected outside African countries. This study aimed to report and analyze the first case of monkeypox virus infection in Taiwan.The global epidemiological information was collected from the World Health Organization (WHO) and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The data from the first confirmed Taiwanese monkeypox case was obtained from Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. Monkeypox diagnosis and prevention strategies were obtained from WHO guidelines on monkeypox. Phylogenetic tree analysis and sequence alignment and comparison were used to identify the phylogeny and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) characterization.Epidemiological data indicated that since 2013, monkeypox has caused outbreaks outside African countries through contact with infected animals and international travels. Recently, two confirmed monkeypox cases were reported in Singapore and South Korea. On June 24, 2022, Taiwan CDC reported the first confirmed case of monkeypox virus infection in a 20-year-old man who returned from Germany, from January to June 2022. This is the third confirmed case of an imported monkeypox infection in Asia. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that this imported monkeypox virus belonged to the West African clade and is clustered with the 2022 European outbreak monkeypox isolates. Full-length sequence analysis indicates that this virus contains 51 SNPs, and has five variant SNPs compared with the recent outbreak strains.This study suggests that active surveillance, enhancing border control, and the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs are urgently required to prevent and control the burden of monkeypox disease.", "Presently, monkeypox has emerged in multiple countries with many confirmed cases, posing a global public health threat. A link has been found between air travel and the international spread of infectious diseases including the previous spread of monkeypox. This article highlights the spread of COVID-19 through air travel, and then monkeypox spread from one country to another. Scientists are trying to establish the air travel and monkeypox spread. Any travel link from an endemic country has not been proven yet to describe the rising number of current monkeypox cases in non-endemic countries. Due to the quantification method, the direct link of the diseases with air travel might be difficult to establish. However, we have also developed different statistical models of the confirmed cases and the number of air travelers per year (noted in countries where monkeypox has spread). As there is no direct link, these models might show a probability of an indirect association of air travel. However, more strong evidence is needed in this direction. Although, the sudden appearance of monkeypox cases in multiple countries in a few days demands comprehensive epidemiological investigations, genome sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis of viral isolates to prove the travel link from an endemic country. At the same time, it is also necessary to know the real cause while also exploring any direct and/or indirect travel links between different countries. Similarly, the possibility of any zoonotic event should find out to understand the more about natural animal reservoir(s) for the monkeypox virus, which is unknown until now. However, this report will help researchers for conducting further explorative research and investigations for understanding transmission patterns and guide policymakers to make proactive policies to limit the spread of monkeypox.", "Since human monkeypox was reported, many related literatures have been published. This study aimed to evaluate the research hotspots and future development trends of human monkeypox by a bibliometric analysis, to analyze the preventive and control measures of various countries in response to human monkeypox outbreaks.The Web of Science Core Collection database was searched for all monkeypox related literature published from 1975 to 2022, and the search strategy was \"TS = monkeypox.\" Bibliometric analysis was performed using VOSviewer software based on retrieval data. Contribution metric methods and visualization were used to analyze the top issues in the field of human monkeypox.From 1975 to 2022, a total of 1,068 monkeypox research papers were included, of which American researchers published 663 papers, and it was also the country that participated in the most international cooperation. Centers for Disease Control Prevention USA is the most prolific institution and a leader in research collaborations. The Journal of Virology has the largest number of published papers on monkeypox. In addition, Damon Inger K has made significant contributions to monkeypox research, with both the most published and the most citation. A total of 2,847 keywords were identified, four top topics were obtained through cluster analysis: (1) human monkeypox epidemiology and species research. (2) human monkeypox virus vaccine and experimental research. (3) human monkeypox disease diagnosis and treatment studies. (4) human monkeypox disease prevention and immunization studies. To curb the spread, regions or countries have developed and implemented detailed managements. The prevention and control measures focus on the isolation of suspected or confirmed patients, the investigation and tracking of the source of the disease, the disposal of pollutants, vaccination and the protection of health workers.The number of human monkeypox literature has grown since 2003. Infection, vaccine and efficacy were the top topic over the past 47 years while the contact tracing, testing, surveillance and vaccination have been the major concerns since the human monkeypox outbreak in May 2022. The treatment and management of human monkeypox deserves further attention.", "The 2022 global human monkeypox outbreak emphasizes the importance of maintaining poxvirus research, including enriching a basic understanding of animal models for developing and advancing therapeutics and vaccines. Intravenous administration of monkeypox virus in macaques is arguably one of the best animal models for evaluating the efficacy of medical countermeasures. Here we addressed one criticism of the model, a requirement for a high-titer administration of virus, as well as improving our understanding of monkeypox virus pathogenesis. To do so, we infected macaques with a challenge dose containing a characterized inoculum enriched for the extracellular form of monkeypox virus. Although there were some differences between diseases caused by the enriched preparation compared with a relatively similar unpurified preparation, we were unable to reduce the viral input with the enriched preparation and maintain severe disease. We found that inherent factors contained within the serum of nonhuman primate blood affect the stability of the monkeypox extracellular virions. As a first step to study a role of the extracellular form in transmission, we also showed the presence of this form in the oropharyngeal swabs from nonhuman primates exposed to monkeypox virus.", "Currently, no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatments for human monkeypox are available. Tecovirimat (Tpoxx), however, is an antiviral drug that has demonstrated efficacy in animal studies and is FDA-approved for treating smallpox. Use of tecovirimat for treatment of monkeypox in the United States is permitted only through an FDA-regulated Expanded Access Investigational New Drug (EA-IND) mechanism. CDC holds a nonresearch EA-IND protocol that facilitates access to and use of tecovirimat for treatment of monkeypox.<sup>\u00a7</sup> The protocol includes patient treatment and adverse event reporting forms to monitor safety and ensure intended clinical use in accordance with FDA EA-IND requirements. The current multinational monkeypox outbreak, first detected in a country where Monkeypox virus infection is not endemic in May 2022, has predominantly affected gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) (1,2). To describe characteristics of persons treated with tecovirimat for Monkeypox virus infection, demographic and clinical data abstracted from available tecovirimat EA-IND treatment forms were analyzed. As of August 20, 2022, intake and outcome forms were available for 549 and 369 patients, respectively; 97.7% of patients were men, with a median age of 36.5 years. Among patients with available data, 38.8% were reported to be non-Hispanic White (White) persons, 99.8% were prescribed oral tecovirimat, and 93.1% were not hospitalized. Approximately one half of patients with Monkeypox virus infection who received tecovirimat were living with HIV infection. The median interval from initiation of tecovirimat to subjective improvement was 3 days and did not differ by HIV infection status. Adverse events were reported in 3.5% of patients; all but one adverse event were nonserious. These data support the continued access to and treatment with tecovirimat for patients with or at risk for severe disease in the ongoing monkeypox outbreak.", "Since May 2022, approximately 20,000 cases of monkeypox have been identified in the United States, part of a global outbreak occurring in approximately 90 countries and currently affecting primarily gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) (1). Monkeypox virus (MPXV) spreads from person to person through close, prolonged contact; a small number of cases have occurred in populations who are not MSM (e.g., women and children), and testing is recommended for persons who meet the suspected case definition* (1). CDC previously developed five real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for detection of orthopoxviruses from lesion specimens (2,3). CDC was granted 510(k) clearance for the nonvariola-orthopoxvirus (NVO)-specific PCR assay by the Food and Drug Administration. This assay was implemented within the Laboratory Response Network (LRN) in the early 2000s and became critical for early detection of MPXV and implementation of public health action in previous travel-associated cases as well as during the current outbreak (4-7). PCR assays (NVO and other Orthopoxvirus laboratory developed tests [LDT]) represent the primary tool for monkeypox diagnosis. These tests are highly sensitive, and cross-contamination from other MPXV specimens being processed, tested, or both alongside negative specimens can occasionally lead to false-positive results. This report describes three patients who had atypical rashes and no epidemiologic link to a monkeypox case or known risk factors; these persons received diagnoses of monkeypox based on late cycle threshold (Ct) values \u226534, which were false-positive test results. The initial diagnoses were followed by administration of antiviral treatment (i.e., tecovirimat) and JYNNEOS vaccine postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) to patients' close contacts. After receiving subsequent testing, none of the three patients was confirmed to have monkeypox. Knowledge gained from these and other cases resulted in changes to CDC guidance. When testing for monkeypox in specimens from patients without an epidemiologic link or risk factors or who do not meet clinical criteria (or where these are unknown), laboratory scientists should reextract and retest specimens with late Ct values (based on this report, Ct \u226534 is recommended) (8). CDC can be consulted for complex cases including those that appear atypical or questionable cases and can perform additional viral species- and clade-specific PCR testing and antiorthopoxvirus serologic testing.", "The global spread of human monkeypox disease, a zoonotic infection related to smallpox and endemic to West and Central Africa, presents serious challenges for health systems. As of July 2022, 14\u2009533 cases have been reported world-wide, leading to designation as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Monkeypox disease is spread from animals to humans through infected lesions or fluids; human-human transmission occurs through fomites, droplets or direct contact. Illness is usually self-limiting, but severe disease can occur in specific groups - particularly children, and people who are immunocompromised or pregnant. Clinical presentation may include fever, lymphadenopathy and skin rash, but the rash may occur without other symptoms. Complications can include secondary bacterial infection of skin lesions, vision loss from corneal involvement, pneumonia, sepsis and encephalitis. Diagnosis of monkeypox requires consideration of epidemiological, clinical and laboratory findings, with sensitive history-taking, to elicit close contacts, critical. Supportive management is usually sufficient, but treatment options (where required) include antivirals and vaccinia immune globulin. A paucity of safety data for relevant antivirals may limit their use. There are two types of monkeypox vaccines: a replication-competent vaccinia vaccine, the use of which is logistically and clinically complex, and a replication-deficient modified vaccinia Ankara virus vaccine. Preparedness of health systems for addressing the current outbreak is constrained by historic underfunding for research, and compounded by stigma and discrimination against cases and affected communities. Key challenges in halting transmission include improving vaccine equity and countering discrimination against men who have sex with men to aid diagnosis and treatment.", "Beginning in May 2022, a rising number of monkeypox cases were reported in non-monkeypox-endemic countries in the Northern Hemisphere. We adapted 2 published quantitative PCRs for use as a dual-target monkeypox virus test on widely used automated high-throughput PCR systems. We determined analytic performance by serial dilutions of monkeypox virus reference material, which we quantified by digital PCR. We found the lower limit of detection for the combined assays was 4.795 (95% CI 3.6-8.6) copies/mL. We compared clinical performance against a commercial manual orthopoxvirus research use only PCR kit by using clinical remnant swab samples. Our assay showed 100% positive (n = 11) and 100% negative (n = 56) agreement. Timely and scalable PCR tests are crucial for limiting further spread of monkeypox. The assay we provide streamlines high-throughput molecular testing for monkeypox virus on existing broadly established platforms used for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing.", "Following an outbreak of cases of vesicular-pustular rash with fever, evocative of human monkeypox, in Bas-U\u00e9l\u00e9 province, Democratic Republic of Congo, surveillance was strengthened.Households with at least one active generalized vesicular-pustular rash case were visited, and contact and clinical history information were collected from all household members. Whenever possible, skin lesions were screened by polymerase chain reaction for the monkeypox virus, followed by the varicella-zoster virus, when negative for the former.Polymerase chain reaction results were obtained for 77 suspected cases, distributed in 138 households, of which 27.3% were positive for monkeypox, 58.4% positive for chickenpox, and 14.3% negative for both. Confirmed monkeypox cases presented more often with monomorphic skin lesions on the palms of the hands and on the soles of the feet. Integrating these three features into the case definition raised the specificity to 85% but would miss 50% of true monkeypox cases. A predictive model fit on patient demographics and symptoms had 97% specificity and 80% sensitivity but only 80% and 33% in predicting out-of-sample cases.Few discriminating features were identified and the performance of clinical case definitions was suboptimal. Rapid field diagnostics are needed to optimize worldwide early detection and surveillance of monkeypox.", "The number of human monkeypox virus infections is increasing in many countries. The typical mode of transmission is by direct contact. As orthopoxviruses may stay infectious on inanimate surfaces under laboratory conditions for up to 42 days, disinfection may be relevant in the surroundings of confirmed cases. The aim of this review was to evaluate published data on the antiviral efficacy of biocidal agents and disinfectants against the monkeypox virus and other orthopoxviruses. A Medline search was carried out on 5<sup>th</sup> June 2022. The terms 'monkeypox virus', 'poxvirus' and 'orthopoxvirus' were used in combination with 'disinfection'. Publications were included and results were extracted where they provided original data on any orthopoxvirus regarding its inactivation by disinfectants. Vaccinia viruses could be inactivated by at least 4 log<sub>10</sub> in suspension tests and on artificially contaminated surfaces by 70% ethanol (\u22641 min), 0.2% peracetic acid (\u226410 min) and 1-10% of a probiotic cleaner (1 h), mostly shown with different types of organic load. Hydrogen peroxide (14.4%) and iodine (0.04-1%) were effective in suspension tests, sodium hypochlorite (0.25-2.5%; 1 min), 2% glutaraldehyde (10 min) and 0.55% orthophthalaldehyde (5 min) were effective on artificially contaminated surfaces. Copper (99.9%) was equally effective against vaccinia virus and monkeypox virus in 3 min. Disinfectants with efficacy data obtained in suspension tests and under practical conditions with different types of organic load resembling compounds of the blood, the respiratory tract and skin lesions are preferred for the inactivation of the monkeypox virus.", "Monkeypox infection is rapidly spreading across the world. Despite the increasing number of cases, only a few reports have been published, and most are on people living without HIV. We report here the first two cases of monkeypox infection in Bahia, Brazil, one of them in a person living with HIV, on stable treatment. Both cases had a similar evolution, with a limited number of lesions and mild symptoms, with a complete recovery after 7-10 days. The potential route of transmission was via oral sex for the first case and was undefined for the second one. Both cases were confirmed through detection of the viral genome by PCR, and the partial sequence of the first case indicates the infection was caused by the West African clade. These cases confirm that monkeypox infection is currently being transmitted in Brazil and that people living with HIV on stable treatment are not likely to present a more severe form of monkeypox.", "Monkeypox, a zoonotic infection caused by an orthopoxvirus, is endemic in parts of Africa. On August 4, 2022, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared the U.S. monkeypox outbreak, which began on May 17, to be a public health emergency (1,2). After detection of the first U.S. monkeypox case), CDC and health departments implemented enhanced monkeypox case detection and reporting. Among 2,891 cases reported in the United States through July 22 by 43 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia (DC), CDC received case report forms for 1,195 (41%) cases by July 27. Among these, 99% of cases were among men; among men with available information, 94% reported male-to-male sexual or close intimate contact during the 3 weeks before symptom onset. Among the 88% of cases with available data, 41% were among non-Hispanic White (White) persons, 28% among Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) persons, and 26% among non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) persons. Forty-two percent of persons with monkeypox with available data did not report the typical prodrome as their first symptom, and 46% reported one or more genital lesions during their illness; 41% had HIV infection. Data suggest that widespread community transmission of monkeypox has disproportionately affected gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men and racial and ethnic minority groups. Compared with historical reports of monkeypox in areas with endemic disease, currently reported outbreak-associated cases are less likely to have a prodrome and more likely to have genital involvement. CDC and other federal, state, and local agencies have implemented response efforts to expand testing, treatment, and vaccination. Public health efforts should prioritize gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, who are currently disproportionately affected, for prevention and testing, while addressing equity, minimizing stigma, and maintaining vigilance for transmission in other populations. Clinicians should test patients with rash consistent with monkeypox,<sup>\u2020</sup> regardless of whether the rash is disseminated or was preceded by prodrome. Likewise, although most cases to date have occurred among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, any patient with rash consistent with monkeypox should be considered for testing. CDC is continually evaluating new evidence and tailoring response strategies as information on changing case demographics, clinical characteristics, transmission, and vaccine effectiveness become available.<sup>\u00a7</sup>.", "For over two decades, researchers have sought to improve smallpox vaccines and also develop therapies to ensure protection against smallpox or smallpox-like disease. The 2022 human monkeypox pandemic is a reminder that these efforts should persist. Advancing such therapies have involved animal models primarily using surrogate viruses such as monkeypox virus. The intravenous monkeypox model in macaques produces a disease that is clinically similar to the lesional phase of fulminant human monkeypox or smallpox. Two criticisms of the model have been the unnatural route of virus administration and the high dose required to induce severe disease. Here, we purified monkeypox virus with the goal of lowering the challenge dose by removing cellular and viral contaminants within the inoculum. We found that there are advantages to using unpurified material for intravenous exposures.", "The neglected and rare zoonotic disease caused by monkeypox virus (MPV) has recently spread widely, resulting in the largest known monkeypox outbreak outside of Africa, where it is endemic. MPV belongs to the Poxviridae family, genus Orthopoxvirus. At least two different clades have been identified, each having different fatality rates but recent cases are all phylogenetically related to the West African clade. MPV is transmitted directly by either person-to-person, -animal, or virus-contaminated fomite contact. The disease is often self-limited, and clinical symptoms include fever, skin lesions, and lymphadenopathies. At present, no deaths have been associated with the current outbreak. MPV DNA detection using molecular techniques is recommended for diagnosis. At least two approved drugs for antiviral therapy are available in the USA. Two different vaccines, including the vaccine used in the past for smallpox eradication and a new formulation more recently approved based on a live but non-replicating virus, are available that provide immunity to MPV. These and other clinical and public health considerations pertaining to the recent monkeypox outbreaks together with aspects of MPV biology are discussed in this article.", "Monkeypox virus is a zoonotic double-stranded DNA poxvirus in the genus <i>Orthopoxvirus</i>, family <i>Poxviridae</i>. Until recently, monkeypox was found primarily in Central and West Africa, where the virus had split into Congo Basin and West African clades.On 6 May 2022, monkeypox was detected in the United Kingdom and the virus has now been detected in every continent except Antarctica. The current outbreak represents the first documentation of widespread community transmission outside of Africa.On 23 July 2022, the World Health Organization declared monkeypox a public health emergency of international concern and issued a series of guidance and recommendations for governments, health professionals and the public. This manuscript reviews what is known about monkeypox virus, with a focus on recent diagnostics and epidemiologic advances, and explores how recent advances in our understanding of the virus will be used to combat the expanding outbreak.", "In 2022, the outbreak of human monkeypox (HMPX) occurred in many non-endemic countries. World Health Organization (WHO) assesses that this outbreak is \"atypical\". The history of monkeypox and HMPX must be reviewed to clearly recognize the \"typical\" outbreaks to fully understand this comment. Therefore, this paper reviews the epidemiological history of monkeypox, especially HMPX, and discusses and analyzes the atypical manifestations and the possible causes of the present outbreak based on the recent views of WHO, other organizations/institutions, and experts. The text describes the thought-provoking history of the interaction between the monkeypox virus and the human being in the past 64 years, and provides various information and views on the outbreak of HMPX, which is helpful to understand risk assessment and the potential impact of this outbreak on clinical and public health in future.", "A rapid outbreak of monkeypox is ongoing in non-endemic countries since May 2022. We report the first case of monkeypox in the Republic of Korea. This occurred in a 34-year-old male patient who traveled to Europe in June 2022. On the day of his return to the Republic of Korea (June 21, 2022), the patient presented with a genital lesion. The results of the monkeypox real-time polymerase chain reaction tests were positive in the penile ulcer, oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal specimens. The patient subsequently developed fever and skin rash after hospital admission. Careful history taking along physical examination should be conducted in the patients who have epidemiologic risk factors for monkeypox. Moreover, appropriate specimens should be obtained from lesions and tested for the monkeypox virus.", "The current outbreak of monkeypox infection has caught the attention of people worldwide. Updated data showed a dramatic increase in the number of patients in many non-endemic countries. An emergence of monkeypox together with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused a tremendous burden on the healthcare system, globally. The aim of this review was to briefly describe the current situation, transmission, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention of the disease. Oral manifestations of monkeypox as well as those of similar viral diseases were elaborately delineated. The outbreak of monkeypox in non-endemic regions has expanded to at least 47 countries with more than 4,100 new infections. The clinical features in non-endemic regions are atypical and different from those in central and western Africa. Milder symptoms with no death cases have been observed. The oral mucosa is often involved and oral lesions may initially be manifested before the rash spreads to the face and other parts of the body. The diagnosis of monkeypox is mainly based on clinical presentations and laboratory investigations. Prevention by avoiding close contacts with patients and sick animals and providing vaccination to those who have a primary contact with patients is essential. Oral manifestations may occur prior to skin eruptions, suggesting that dentists and dental personnel should be well aware of the nature of the disease. Prevention and public awareness of the disease are crucial for mitigating further human-to-human transmission.", "The current unprecedented Monkeypox outbreaks emergence and spread on non-endemic countries has led to over 3413 laboratory confirmed cases and one death, and yet, does not constitute a public health emergency of international concern as June 23th 2022. We urgently call for collective regional and global partnership, leadership commitment and investment to rapidly strengthen and implement Monkeypox World\u00a0Health\u00a0Organization outbreak Preparedness and emergency response actions plans implementation against Monkeypox outbreak. Given the importance of human-animal-environment interface and transmission dynamics, fostering global and regional One Health approach partnership and multisectoral collaboration programs have timely and robust sustained investment benefits on poverty-linked Monkeypox and other emerging epidemics population-based programs, while leveraging from lessons learnt. Moving forward requires addressing priority research questions listed and closing the knowledge gaps for Monkeypox and others neglected tropical diseases roadmap implementation in vulnerable and at risk countries.", "Following two reports of monkeypox virus infection in individuals who returned from Nigeria to the USA, one who returned to Texas (July 2021) and the other to the Washington, DC area (November 2021), the number of monkeypox infection have dramatically increased. This sounded an alarm of potential for spreading of the virus throughout the USA. During 2022, there was a report of monkeypox virus infection (May 6, 2022) in a British national following a visit to Nigeria who developed readily recognizable signs and symptoms of monkeypox virus infection. Soon following this report, case numbers climbed. By June 10, 2022, more than 1,500 cases were reported in 43 countries, including Europe and North America. While the prevalence of the monkeypox virus is well known in central and western Africa, its presence in the developed world has raised disturbing signs for worldwide spread. While infection was reported during the past half-century, starting in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1970, in the United States, only sporadic monkeypox cases have been reported. All cases have been linked to international travel or through African animal imports. The monkeypox virus is transmitted through contact with infected skin, body fluids, or respiratory droplets. The virus spreads from oral and nasopharyngeal fluid exchanges or by intradermal injection; then rapidly replicates at the inoculation site with spreads to adjacent lymph nodes. Monkeypox disease begins with constitutional symptoms that include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, backache, and fatigue. Phylogenetically the virus has two clades. One clade emerged from West Africa and the other in the Congo Basin of Central Africa. During the most recent outbreak, the identity of the reservoir host or the primary carriage remains unknown. African rodents are the suspected intermediate hosts. At the same time, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) affirmed that there are no specific treatments for the 2022 monkeypox virus infection; existing antivirals shown to be effective against smallpox may slow monkeypox spread. A smallpox vaccine JYNNEOS (Imvamune or Imvanex) may also be used to prevent infection. The World Health Organization (WHO), has warned that the world could be facing a formidable infectious disease challenge in light of the current status of worldwide affairs. These affairs include the SARS-COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine-Russia war. In addition, the recent rise in case of numbers worldwide could continue to pose an international threat. With this in mind, strategies to mitigate the spread of monkeypox virus are warranted.", "On May 17, 2022, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) Laboratory Response Network (LRN) laboratory confirmed the presence of orthopoxvirus DNA via real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from lesion swabs obtained from a Massachusetts resident. Orthopoxviruses include Monkeypox virus, the causative agent of monkeypox. Subsequent real-time PCR testing at CDC on May 18 confirmed that the patient was infected with the West African clade of Monkeypox virus. Since then, confirmed cases* have been reported by nine states. In addition, 28 countries and territories,<sup>\u2020</sup> none of which has endemic monkeypox, have reported laboratory-confirmed cases. On May 17, CDC, in coordination with state and local jurisdictions, initiated an emergency response to identify, monitor, and investigate additional monkeypox cases in the United States. This response has included releasing a Health Alert Network (HAN) Health Advisory, developing interim public health and clinical recommendations, releasing guidance for LRN testing, hosting clinician and public health partner outreach calls, disseminating health communication messages to the public, developing protocols for use and release of medical countermeasures, and facilitating delivery of vaccine postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) and antivirals that have been stockpiled by the U.S. government for preparedness and response purposes. On May 19, a call center was established to provide guidance to states for the evaluation of possible cases of monkeypox, including recommendations for clinical diagnosis and orthopoxvirus testing. The call center also gathers information about possible cases to identify interjurisdictional linkages. As of May 31, this investigation has identified 17<sup>\u00a7</sup> cases in the United States; most cases (16) were diagnosed in persons who identify as gay, bisexual, or men who have sex with men (MSM). Ongoing investigation suggests person-to-person community transmission, and CDC urges health departments, clinicians, and the public to remain vigilant, institute appropriate infection prevention and control measures, and notify public health authorities of suspected cases to reduce disease spread. Public health authorities are identifying cases and conducting investigations to determine possible sources and prevent further spread. This activity was reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.<sup>\u00b6</sup>.", "A monkeypox (MPX) outbreak has expanded worldwide since May 2022. We tested 147 clinical samples collected at different time points from 12 patients by real-time PCR. MPX DNA was detected in saliva from all cases, sometimes with high viral loads. Other samples were frequently positive: rectal swab (11/12 cases), nasopharyngeal swab (10/12 cases), semen (7/9 cases), urine (9/12 cases) and faeces (8/12 cases). These results improve knowledge on virus shedding and the possible role of bodily fluids in disease transmission.", "Monkeypox is a rare zoonotic infection caused by monkeypox virus. It is an emerging disease which has become the most prevalent orthopoxvirus since the global eradication of smallpox in 1980. It is a mild illness which is mostly characterized by a prodromal of fever, malaise and progressive appearance of vesiculo-papular skin lesions. We report a case of a 30-year-old military personnel who was referred from 23 Brigade Medical Centre (BMC) to Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Yola on account of fever and progressive eruption of widespread skin rashes. Following isolation from suspicion of monkeypox, he was confirmed by PCR and managed symptomatically and fully recovered within two weeks of onset. His five close contacts did not develop any symptoms during the period of follow-up. This is the first confirmed case of monkey pox in the state. This case will trigger an awareness, amongst clinicians and surveillance officers in Adamawa State, of the existence of monkeypox and heighten the suspicion to promptly detect, isolate and treat more cases to halt transmission.", "Monkeypox is a rare, sometimes life-threatening zoonotic infection that occurs in west and central Africa. It is caused by Monkeypox virus, an orthopoxvirus similar to Variola virus (the causative agent of smallpox) and Vaccinia virus (the live virus component of orthopoxvirus vaccines) and can spread to humans. After 39 years without detection of human disease in Nigeria, an outbreak involving 118 confirmed cases was identified during 2017-2018 (1); sporadic cases continue to occur. During September 2018-May 2021, six unrelated persons traveling from Nigeria received diagnoses of monkeypox in non-African countries: four in the United Kingdom and one each in Israel and Singapore. In July 2021, a man who traveled from Lagos, Nigeria, to Dallas, Texas, became the seventh traveler to a non-African country with diagnosed monkeypox. Among 194 monitored contacts, 144 (74%) were flight contacts. The patient received tecovirimat, an antiviral for treatment of orthopoxvirus infections, and his home required large-scale decontamination. Whole genome sequencing showed that the virus was consistent with a strain of Monkeypox virus known to circulate in Nigeria, but the specific source of the patient's infection was not identified. No epidemiologically linked cases were reported in Nigeria; no contact received postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) with the orthopoxvirus vaccine ACAM2000.", "Monkeypox is an emerging infection that has spread to all continents since May 2022. It is caused by the zoonotic monkeypox virus, consisting of double-stranded DNA, belonging to the Orthopoxvirus genus of the Poxviridae family, which has high transmissibility, especially by contact with the skin, favoring its sexual transmission. This case report describes a same-sex male couple, both aged 28 years old, without comorbidities. In the index case, perioral and penile lesions started ten days before the consultation, with rapid progression and a high fever that started eight days after the appearance of the lesions. In the second case, the perioral lesions started three days after the partner; however, he remained afebrile. Both were isolated, treated with symptomatic measures, and, after ulceration, the lesions completely regressed in 14 days. Dermatologists should be aware of manifestations of monkeypox, which may include vesiculopustular lesions in areas of sexual contact, as well as oligosymptomatic cases or cases with few skin lesions.", "Monkeypox is a zoonotic disease caused by Monkeypox virus, which can cause the change of smallpox pattern in human. Monkeypox has been epidemic in central and west African countries, and infections outside the African continent are rare. Since May 2022, unprecedented outbreaks of human monkeypox and clusters of cases have occurred in non-epidemic countries such as Europe, the Americas and Australia, with multi-country outbreaks drawing global attention. The prevalence, transmission route and reoccurrence of monkeypox are still unknown. In view of the rapid increase of monkeypox cases, this paper reviewed the epidemiological changes, outbreak causes, clinical characteristics, and treatment methods of monkeypox, so as to clarify the epidemic background and transmission characteristics, improve the understanding of the disease, prevent the disease as soon as possible and formulate diagnosis and treatment measures.", "<b>Background:</b> Human monkeypox is a zoonosis caused by the monkeypox virus, an orthopoxvirus and close relative of variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox. The disease was first reported in central Africa in 1970, where it continues to be endemic and has historically affected some of the poorest and most marginalized communities in the world. The condition has recently attracted global attention due to >14,000 cases, including five deaths, reported by the World Health Organization, and a total of 5189 confirmed monkeypox cases in the United States reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as of July 29, 2022. On July 23, 2022, the World Health Organization declared the current monkeypox outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. <b>Objective:</b> The purpose of the present report was to review the epidemiology of monkeypox viral infection; its clinical manifestations; and current recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and use of vaccines for prevention of the disease, with a focus on those aspects that have particular relevance to the allergist/immunologist. <b>Results:</b> Monkeypox was discovered in the early 1970s and, for years, has been well described by researchers in west and central Africa, where the disease has been present for decades. Although this outbreak thus far has mostly affected men who have sex with men, it is possible that the disease could become endemic and could begin spreading in settings where there is close physical contact, which is how the virus is transmitted. <b>Conclusion:</b> Monkeypox is a different viral infection from the coronavirus. Unlike the coronavirus, which is an extremely contagious respiratory pathogen, monkeypox is primarily transmitted through body fluids and/or prolonged skin-to-skin contact. Although the control of monkeypox will require renewed efforts and resources, we have learned much from the past and have the tools to stop this virus from becoming yet another serious illness with which Americans have to contend. The allergist/immunologist can play a significant role.", "Monkeypox is a zoonotic disease that was once endemic in west and central Africa caused by monkeypox virus. However, cases recently have been confirmed in many nonendemic countries outside of Africa. WHO declared the ongoing monkeypox outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern on July 23, 2022, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The rapidly increasing number of confirmed cases could pose a threat to the international community. Here, we review the epidemiology of monkeypox, monkeypox virus reservoirs, novel transmission patterns, mutations and mechanisms of viral infection, clinical characteristics, laboratory diagnosis and treatment measures. In addition, strategies for the prevention, such as vaccination of smallpox vaccine, is also included. Current epidemiological data indicate that high frequency of human-to-human transmission could lead to further outbreaks, especially among men who have sex with men. The development of antiviral drugs and vaccines against monkeypox virus is urgently needed, despite some therapeutic effects of currently used drugs in the clinic. We provide useful information to improve the understanding of monkeypox virus and give guidance for the government and relative agency to prevent and control the further spread of monkeypox virus.", "Since May 2022, a new outbreak of monkeypox has been reported in several countries, including Spain. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the cases in this outbreak may differ from those in earlier reports.To document the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of cases of monkeypox in the current outbreak.We conducted a prospective cross-sectional study in multiple medical facilities in Spain to describe the cases of monkeypox in the 2022 outbreak.In total, 185 patients were included. Most cases started with primarily localized homogeneous papules, not pustules, in the probable area of inoculation, which could be cutaneous or mucous, including single lesions. Generalized small pustules appeared later in some of them. Heterogeneous lesions occurred during this generalized phase. All patients had systemic symptoms. Less common lesions included mucosal ulcers (including pharyngeal ulcers and proctitis) and monkeypox whitlows. Four patients were hospitalized, none died. Smallpox vaccination and well-controlled HIV disease were not associated with markers of severity. Contact during sex is the most likely mechanism of transmission. In this outbreak, cases have been described in men who have sex with men and are strongly associated with high-risk sexual behaviours. Seventy-six per cent of the patients had other sexually transmitted diseases upon screening.The clinical findings in this outbreak differ from previous findings and highly suggest contact transmission and initiation at the entry site. The characterization of the epidemiology of this outbreak has implications for control. What is already known about this topic? Monkeypox eruption is described as consisting of pustules. The roles of HIV and previous smallpox vaccination in the prognosis are unknown. The transmission route was initially described as respiratory droplets and was later suggested to be via sexual contact. What does this study add? Initial lesions at the probable inoculation area were homogeneous and papular (pseudopustules). Generalized small pustules appeared later in some of them. Heterogeneous lesions occurred during this generalized phase. All patients had systemic symptoms. Less common signs included mucosal ulcers (including pharyngeal ulcers and proctitis) and monkeypox whitlows. Well-controlled HIV and previous smallpox vaccination were not associated with severity. No patient died. The data support the hypothesis of transmission via contact during sex. Although this might change, the outbreak is currently limited mostly to men who have sex with men, with high-risk factors for sexually transmitted diseases.", "Vaccination with JYNNEOS vaccine (Modified Vaccinia Ankara vaccine, Bavarian Nordic) to prevent monkeypox commenced shortly after confirmation of the first monkeypox case in the current outbreak in the United States on May 17, 2022 (1). To date, more than 27,000 cases have been reported across all 50 states, the District of Columbia (DC), and Puerto Rico.* JYNNEOS vaccine is licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a 0.5-mL 2-dose series administered subcutaneously 28 days apart to prevent smallpox and monkeypox infections (2) and has been found to provide protection against monkeypox infection during the current outbreak (3). The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) allocated 1.1 million vials of JYNNEOS vaccine from the Strategic National Stockpile, with doses allocated to jurisdictions based on case counts and estimated size of population at risk (4). However, initial vaccine supplies were severely constrained relative to vaccine demand during the expanding outbreak. Some jurisdictions with highest incidence responded by prioritizing first dose administration during May-July (5,6). The FDA emergency use authorization (EUA) of 0.1 mL dosing for intradermal administration of JYNNEOS for persons aged \u226518 years on August 9, 2022, substantially expanded available vaccine supply<sup>\u2020</sup> (7). The U.S. vaccination strategy focuses primarily on persons with known or presumed exposures to monkeypox (8) or those at high risk for occupational exposure (9). Data on monkeypox vaccine doses administered and reported to CDC by U.S. jurisdictions were analyzed to assess vaccine administration and completion of the 2-dose series. A total of 931,155 doses of JYNNEOS vaccine were administered and reported to the CDC by 55 U.S. jurisdictions during May 22-October 10, 2022. Among persons who received \u22651 dose, 51.4% were non-Hispanic White (White), 22.5% were Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic), and 12.6% were non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black). The percentages of vaccine recipients who were Black (5.6%) and Hispanic (15.5%) during May 22-June 25 increased to 13.3% and 22.7%, respectively, during July 31-October 10. Among 496,888 persons who received a first dose and were eligible for a second dose during the study period, 57.6% received their second dose. Second dose receipt was highest among older adults, White persons, and those residing in the South U.S. Census Bureau Region. Tracking and addressing disparities in vaccination can reduce inequities, and equitable access to and acceptance of vaccine should be an essential factor in planning vaccination programs, events, and strategies. Receipt of both first and second doses is necessary for optimal protection against Monkeypox virus infection.", "An imported case of monkeypox was diagnosed in December 2019 in a traveller returning from Nigeria to the UK. Subsequently, environmental sampling was performed at two adjoining single-room residences occupied by the patient and their sibling. Monkeypox virus DNA was identified in multiple locations throughout both properties, and monkeypox virus was isolated from several samples 3\u2009days after the patient was last in these locations. Positive samples were identified following the use of both vacuum and surface sampling techniques; these methodologies allowed for environmental analysis of potentially contaminated porous and non-porous surfaces via real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR analysis in addition to viral isolation to confirm the presence of infection-competent virus. This report confirms the potential for infection-competent monkeypox virus to be recovered in environmental settings associated with known positive cases and the necessity for rapid environmental assessment to reduce potential exposure to close contacts and the general public. The methods adopted in this investigation may be used for future confirmed cases of monkeypox in order to establish levels of contamination, confirm the presence of infection-competent material and to identify locations requiring additional cleaning.", "Between January 1, 2022 and July 4, 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) received 6,027 reports of laboratory-confirmed patients of monkeypox, predominantly men, that had occurred during a multi-country outbreak of the virus. During this period, 21 women and six children were reportedly infected with the monkeypox virus. Although the infected number of women and children was small, these data are worrisome, because young children and pregnant women are at increased risk of severe outcomes from monkeypox. One infant already has been hospitalized in intensive care in London, England. The WHO data regarding the 2022 monkeypox outbreak also indicate that 25 healthcare workers have been diagnosed with monkeypox, although it is still being investigated whether their infection was due to occupational exposure. Three deaths from monkeypox have been reported to WHO during this monkeypox outbreak. A special focus of this presentation is on the monkeypox infection involving women and children.", "Between January 1, 2022 and July 4, 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) received 6,027 reports of laboratory-confirmed patients of monkeypox, predominantly men, that had occurred during a multi-country outbreak of the virus.

(<i>SKINmed</i>. 2022;20:334-335).", "Monkeypox is a zoonosis caused by monkeypox virus. Monkeypox virus belongs to the <i>Orthopoxviruses</i> genus in the <i>Poxviridae</i> family, which is regarded as the most important <i>Orthopoxvirus</i> infection in human beings after the extinction of smallpox. Since the first human monkeypox case was reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1970, monkeypox has become endemic in Central and West African. From May 6 to July 15, 2022, monkeypox has broken out in many countries. Monkeypox cases have been detected in 62 countries and regions. Moreover, human to human transmission has occurred and attracted high global attention. Monkeypox virus has been discovered for more than 60 years, but the understanding and research of its natural host, epidemiological characteristics and treatment are still relatively limited. Therefore, this study analyzes the epidemic situation, the possible causes of the outbreak and the future key research directions, and puts forward countermeasures to provide scientific basis for the prevention and control of monkeypox.", "Infection control is critical for the safe delivery of dental care. Infection control practices must be responsive to emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases and outbreaks, as was clearly seen during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. An emerging global outbreak of the monkeypox virus has again raised potential challenges for infection control in dentistry. Monkeypox is an infectious disease, characterised by a rash affecting the skin and soft tissues, including the oral cavity. Previously, cases were mostly seen following contact with infected animals in Central and West Africa, with limited human-to-human transmission within and outside of these areas. However, since May 2022, sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred globally. Monkeypox can be transmitted via close contact with an infected person, contaminated objects and surfaces, or by droplets and possibly aerosols, which is therefore of potential importance to dental settings. This article discusses the relevance of monkeypox to dental professionals, the typical presentation of the disease, its potential impact on infection prevention and control practices and the delivery of dental services. The current monkeypox outbreak highlights the need for a more sustained programme of research into dental infection control that can provide a solid evidence base to underpin preparedness planning for future outbreaks and pandemics.", "Human monkeypox is caused by Monkeypox virus (MPXV), an Orthopoxvirus, previously rare in the United States (1). The first U.S. case of monkeypox during the current outbreak was identified on May 17, 2022 (2). As of September 28, 2022, a total of 25,341 monkeypox cases have been reported in the United States.* The outbreak has disproportionately affected gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) (3). JYNNEOS vaccine (Modified Vaccinia Ankara vaccine, Bavarian Nordic), administered subcutaneously as a 2-dose (0.5 mL per dose) series with doses administered 4 weeks apart, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2019 to prevent smallpox and monkeypox infection (4). U.S. distribution of JYNNEOS vaccine as postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) for persons with known exposures to MPXV began in May 2022. A U.S. national vaccination strategy<sup>\u2020</sup> for expanded PEP, announced on June 28, 2022, recommended subcutaneous vaccination of persons with known or presumed exposure to MPXV, broadening vaccination eligibility. FDA emergency use authorization (EUA) of intradermal administration of 0.1 mL of JYNNEOS on August 9, 2022, increased vaccine supply (5). As of September 28, 2022, most vaccine has been administered as PEP or expanded PEP. Because of the limited amount of time that has elapsed since administration of initial vaccine doses, as of September 28, 2022, relatively few persons in the current outbreak have completed the recommended 2-dose series.<sup>\u00a7</sup> To examine the incidence of monkeypox among persons who were unvaccinated and those who had received \u22651 JYNNEOS vaccine dose, 5,402 reported monkeypox cases occurring among males<sup>\u00b6</sup> aged 18-49 years during July 31-September 3, 2022, were analyzed by vaccination status across 32 U.S. jurisdictions.** Average monkeypox incidence (cases per 100,000) among unvaccinated persons was 14.3 (95% CI = 5.0-41.0) times that among persons who received 1 dose of JYNNEOS vaccine \u226514 days earlier. Monitoring monkeypox incidence by vaccination status in timely surveillance data might provide early indications of vaccine-related protection that can be confirmed through other well-controlled vaccine effectiveness studies. This early finding suggests that a single dose of JYNNEOS vaccine provides some protection against monkeypox infection. The degree and durability of such protection is unknown, and it is recommended that people who are eligible for monkeypox vaccination receive the complete 2-dose series.", "Knowledge about monkeypox transmission risk in congregate settings is limited. In July 2022, the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) confirmed a case of monkeypox in a person detained in Cook County Jail (CCJ) in Chicago, Illinois. This case was the first identified in a correctional setting in the United States and reported to CDC during the 2022 multinational monkeypox outbreak. CDPH collaborated with CCJ, the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH), and CDC to evaluate transmission risk within the facility. Fifty-seven residents were classified as having intermediate-risk exposures to the patient with monkeypox during the 7-day interval between the patient's symptom onset and his isolation. (Intermediate-risk exposure was defined as potentially being within 6 ft of the patient with monkeypox for a total of \u22653 hours cumulatively, without wearing a surgical mask or respirator, or potentially having contact between their own intact skin or clothing and the skin lesions or body fluids from the patient or with materials that were in contact with the patient's skin lesions or body fluids.) No secondary cases were identified among a subset of 62% of these potentially exposed residents who received symptom monitoring, serologic testing, or both. Thirteen residents accepted postexposure prophylaxis (PEP), with higher acceptance among those who were offered counseling individually or in small groups than among those who were offered PEP together in a large group. Monkeypox virus (MPXV) DNA, but no viable virus, was detected on one surface in a dormitory where the patient had been housed with other residents before he was isolated. Although monkeypox transmission might be limited in similar congregate settings in the absence of higher-risk exposures, congregate facilities should maintain recommended infection control practices in response to monkeypox cases, including placing the person with monkeypox in medical isolation and promptly and thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting spaces where the person has spent time. In addition, officials should provide information to residents and staff members about monkeypox symptoms and transmission modes, facilitate confidential monkeypox risk and symptom disclosure and prompt medical evaluation for symptoms that are reported, and provide PEP counseling in a private setting.", "Recently, human monkeypox outbreaks have been reported in many countries. According to the reports and studies, quick determination and isolation of infected people are essential to reduce the spread rate. This study presents an Android mobile application that uses deep learning to assist this situation. The application has been developed with Android Studio using Java programming language and Android SDK 12. Video images gathered through the mobile device's camera are dispatched to a deep convolutional neural network that runs on the same device. Camera2 API of the Android platform has been used for camera access and operations. The network then classifies images as positive or negative for monkeypox detection. The network's training has been carried out using skin lesion images of monkeypox-infected people and other skin lesion images. For this purpose, a publicly available dataset and a deep transfer learning approach have been used. All training and testing steps have been applied on Matlab using different pre-trained networks. Then, the network that has the best accuracy has been recreated and trained using TensorFlow. The TensorFlow model has been adapted to mobile devices by converting to the TensorFlow Lite model. The TensorFlow Lite model has been then embedded into the mobile application together with the TensorFlow Lite library for monkeypox detection. The application has been run on three devices successfully. During the run-time, the inference times have been gathered. 197 ms, 91 ms, and 138 ms average inference times have been observed. The presented system allows people with body lesions to quickly make a preliminary diagnosis. Thus, monkeypox-infected people can be encouraged to act rapidly to see an expert for a definitive diagnosis. According to the test results, the system can classify the images with 91.11% accuracy. In addition, the proposed mobile application can be trained for the preliminary diagnosis of other skin diseases.", "The ongoing monkeypox virus outbreak includes at least 7553 confirmed cases in previously non-endemic countries worldwide as of July 2022. Clinical presentation has been reported as highly variable, sometimes lacking classically described systemic symptoms, and only small numbers of cutaneous lesions in most patients. The aim of this study was to compare clinical data with longitudinal qPCR results from lesion swabs, oropharyngeal swabs and blood in a well characterized patient cohort.16 male patients (5 hospitalized, 11 outpatients) were included in the study cohort and serial testing for monkeypox virus-DNA carried out in various materials throughout the course of disease. Laboratory analysis included quantitative PCR, next-generation sequencing, immunofluorescence tests and virus isolation in cell culture.All patients were male, between age 20 and 60, and self-identified as men having sex with men. Two had a known HIV infection, coinciding with an increased number of lesions and viral DNA detectable in blood. In initial- and serial testing, lesion swabs yielded viral DNA-loads at, or above 10<sup>6</sup> cp/ml and only declined during the third week. Oropharyngeal swabs featured lower viral loads and returned repeatedly negative in some cases. Viral culture was successful only from lesion swabs but not from oropharyngeal swabs or plasma.The data presented underscore the reliability of lesion swabs for monkeypox virus-detection, even in later stages of the disease. Oropharyngeal swabs and blood samples alone carry the risk of false negative results, but may hold value in pre-/asymptomatic cases or viral load monitoring, respectively.", "Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is an orthopoxvirus in the Poxviridae family. The current multinational monkeypox outbreak has now spread to 96 countries that have not historically reported monkeypox, with most cases occurring among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (1,2). The first monkeypox case in the United States associated with this outbreak was identified in May 2022 in Massachusetts (1); monkeypox has now been reported in all 50 states, the District of Columbia (DC), and one U.S. territory. MPXV is transmitted by close contact with infected persons or animals; infection results in a febrile illness followed by a diffuse vesiculopustular rash and lymphadenopathy. However, illness in the MPXV current Clade II outbreak has differed: the febrile prodrome is frequently absent or mild, and the rash often involves genital, anal, or oral regions (3,4). Although neuroinvasive disease has been previously reported with MPXV infection (5,6), it appears to be rare. This report describes two cases of encephalomyelitis in patients with monkeypox disease that occurred during the current U.S. outbreak. Although neurologic complications of acute MPXV infections are rare, suspected cases should be reported to state, tribal, local, or territorial health departments to improve understanding of the range of clinical manifestations of and treatment options for MPXV infections during the current outbreak.", "The risk for monkeypox transmission to health care personnel (HCP) caring for symptomatic patients is thought to be low but has not been thoroughly assessed in the context of the current global outbreak (1). Monkeypox typically spreads through close physical (often skin-to-skin) contact with lesions or scabs, body fluids, or respiratory secretions of a person with an active monkeypox infection. CDC currently recommends that HCP wear a gown, gloves, eye protection, and an N95 (or higher-level) respirator while caring for patients with suspected or confirmed monkeypox to protect themselves from infection<sup>\u2020</sup> (1,2). The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) evaluated HCP exposures and personal protective equipment (PPE) use in health care settings during care of patients who subsequently received a diagnosis of Orthopoxvirus infection (presumptive monkeypox determined by a polymerase chain reaction [PCR] DNA assay) or monkeypox (real-time PCR assay and genetic sequencing performed by CDC). During May 1-July 31, 2022, a total of 313 HCP interacted with patients with subsequently diagnosed monkeypox infections while wearing various combinations of PPE; 23% wore all recommended PPE during their exposures. Twenty-eight percent of exposed HCP were considered to have had high- or intermediate-risk exposures and were therefore eligible to receive postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) with the JYNNEOS vaccine<sup>\u00a7</sup>; among those, 48% (12% of all exposed HCP) received the vaccine. PPE use varied by facility type: HCP in sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics and community health centers reported the highest adherence to recommended PPE use, and primary and urgent care settings reported the lowest adherence. No HCP developed a monkeypox infection during the 21 days after exposure. These results suggest that the risk for transmission of monkeypox in health care settings is low. Infection prevention training is important in all health care settings, and these findings can guide future updates to PPE recommendations and risk classification in health care settings.", "Monkeypox virus (MPV) is a smallpox-like virus belonging to the genus <i>Orthopoxvirus</i> of the family Poxviridae. Unlike smallpox with no animal reservoir identified and patients suffering from milder symptoms with less mortality, several animals were confirmed to serve as natural hosts of MPV. The reemergence of a recently reported monkeypox epidemic outbreak in nonendemic countries has raised concerns about a global outburst. Since the underlying mechanism of animal-to-human transmission remains largely unknown, comprehensive analyses to discover principal differences in gene signatures during disease progression have become ever more critical. In this study, two MPV-infected <i>in vitro</i> models, including human immortal epithelial cancer (HeLa) cells and rhesus monkey (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) kidney epithelial (MK2) cells, were chosen as the two subjects to identify alterations in gene expression profiles, together with co-regulated genes and pathways that are affected during monkeypox disease progression. Using Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and MetaCore analyses, we discovered that elevated expression of genes associated with interleukins (ILs), G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), heat shock proteins (HSPs), Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and metabolic-related pathways play major roles in disease progression of both monkeypox-infected monkey MK2 and human HeLa cell lines. Interestingly, our analytical results also revealed that a cluster of differentiation 40 (CD40), plasmin, and histamine served as major regulators in the monkeypox-infected monkey MK2 cell line model, while interferons (IFNs), macrophages, and neutrophil-related signaling pathways dominated the monkeypox-infected human HeLa cell line model. Among immune pathways of interest, apart from traditional monkeypox-regulated signaling pathways such as nuclear factor- (NF-<i>\u03ba</i>B), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and tumor necrosis factors (TNFs), we also identified highly significantly expressed genes in both monkey and human models that played pivotal roles during the progression of monkeypox infection, including <i>CXCL1</i>, <i>TNFAIP3</i>, <i>BIRC3</i>, <i>IL6</i>, <i>CCL2</i>, <i>ZC3H12A</i>, <i>IL11</i>, <i>CSF2</i>, <i>LIF</i>, <i>PTX3</i>, <i>IER3</i>, <i>EGR1</i>, <i>ADORA2A</i>, and <i>DUOX1</i>, together with several epigenetic regulators, such as histone cluster family gene members, <i>HIST1H3D</i>, <i>HIST1H2BJ</i>, etc. These findings might contribute to specific underlying mechanisms related to the pathophysiology and provide suggestions regarding modes of transmission, post-infectious sequelae, and vaccine development for monkeypox in the future.", "In 2022, an outbreak of monkeypox is being reported in non-endemic areas, with unusual clinical manifestations. The detailed clinical description of the first patient that received the diagnosis of monkeypox in Brazil is reported here, whose clinical manifestations can easily lead to misdiagnosis of sexually transmitted infections. A 41 years old male presented to an emergency room with a vesicular rash with eight days of evolution. He had traveled to Portugal and Spain and reported non-penetrative sexual involvement with three different male individuals. On the third day of symptoms, he sought medical care and received empirical treatment directed to sexually transmitted infections. As the symptoms did not improve, he sought medical attention at an infectious disease referral center presenting, on admission, an ulcerated penile lesion with central necrotic crusts, a disseminated pleomorphic skin rash and an oropharyngeal ulcer. The monkeypox diagnosis was suspected due to the characteristics of the lesions and the history of intimate contact with casual partners, and it was later confirmed by sequencing the almost complete monkeypox genome. The patient was hospitalized for pain control, which required opiate administration. He developed a secondary bacterial infection on the penile lesions, which were treated with oral antibiotics. He was discharged after 14 days, with lesions in process of re-epithelialization. Given the current outbreak, we must consider the possibility of monkeypox in patients with suggestive lesions, anywhere on the body (including the genitals), added to an epidemiological link or history of intimate contact with strangers or casual partners.", "An ongoing monkeypox outbreak in non-endemic countries has resulted in the declaration of a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO). Though monkeypox has long been endemic in regions of sub-Saharan Africa, relatively little is known about its ecology, epidemiology, and transmission. Here, we consider the relevant research on both monkeypox and smallpox, a close relative, to make inferences about the current outbreak. Undetected circulation combined with atypical transmission and case presentation, including mild and asymptomatic disease, have facilitated the spread of monkeypox in non-endemic regions. A broader availability of diagnostics, enhanced surveillance, and targeted education, combined with a better understanding of the routes of transmission, are critical to identify at-risk populations and design science-based countermeasures to control the current outbreak.", "Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is an enveloped double-stranded DNA virus with a genome of approximately 197.209 bp. The current classification divides MPXV into three clades: Clade I (Central African or Congo Basin clade) and clades IIa and IIb (West African clades).To report the complete genome and phylogenetic analysis of a human monkeypox case detected in Colombia.Exudate from vesicular lesions was obtained from a male patient with recent travel history to Spain. A direct genomic approach was implemented in which total DNA from the sample was purified through a column-based method, followed by sequencing on the Nanopore GridION. Reads were aligned against the MPXV reference genome using minimap2 v.2.24 and phylogenetic inference was performed using maximum likelihood estimation.A total of 11.951 reads mapped directly to a reference genome with 96.8% of coverage (190.898 bp).Phylogenetic analysis of the MPXV circulating in Colombia demonstrated its close relationship to clade IIb responsible for the multi-country outbreak in 2022.", "Viral infectious diseases have various neurological manifestations, whether they are epidemic or pandemic in nature. Nonspecific encephalopathy is the most common central nervous system (CNS) manifestation. The spectrum of nervous evidence varies for viral pathogens. Some infectious viruses, such as the Ebola virus, exhibit direct neurotropism. Others, such as the Rift Valley fever virus, have the potential for neurotropism. Direct neurotropism is unknown in monkeypox virus, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and even smallpox. As seen in the COVID-19, there may be evidence of para-infectious neurological syndrome. There have only been a few reports of neurological diseases caused by monkeypox infection. Future efforts to prevent the spread of infectious disease surges can reduce mortality complications, the therapeutic burden on the health-care system, and prevent further spread. This study describes the clinical and neurological complications of monkeypox infection, particularly encephalitis, as well as the laboratory diagnosis of these cases.", "Human monkeypox (MPX) is a zoonotic endemic disease in regions of Africa caused by the monkeypox virus, with a recent outbreak in several non-African countries. We report a case of a 24-year-old male patient with a concurrent diagnosis of MPX and acute HIV infection who presented to our Emergency Care Dermatology Clinic with disseminated papules throughout the trunk, face and genital area. On the perianal area, several grouped umbilicated whitish papules in a kissing lesion configuration could be seen. Laboratory workups were consistent with recent HIV infection, and swab samples from the lesion surfaces were positive for monkeypox virus. We provide novel information on the clinical presentation of MPX, expanding the data pool of the clinical manifestations of which health workers should be aware.", "Monkeypox is caused by an orthopoxvirus, which is a DNA virus. Monkeypox is a zoonotic viral infection that has been endemic in West Africa and Central Africa for over a decade. Between 1 January and 22 June 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 3,413 laboratory-confirmed cases of monkeypox from 50 countries. Most cases (86%) were reported from Europe, with 2% from Africa and 11% from North and South America. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified an outbreak of monkeypox on May 17, 2022. In 99% of cases, the patients were men, 94% reported male-to-male sexual contact or intimate contact in the three weeks before they experienced symptoms of infection, 46% reported one or more genital lesions, and 41% had HIV infection. This initial data from the US showed widespread community transmission of monkeypox that mainly affected bisexual, gay, other men who had sex with men, and also ethnic and racial minority groups. Therefore, public health efforts in the US aim to prioritize these specific demographic groups for infection prevention and testing. By August 4, 2022, the US Department of Health and Human Services declared the monkeypox outbreak a public health emergency. This Editorial aims to present the current status of non-endemic global infections with the monkeypox virus, and current strategies for its prevention and management.", "Historically, human monkeypox virus cases in the UK have been limited to imported infections from west Africa. Currently, the UK and several other countries are reporting a rapid increase in monkeypox cases among individuals attending sexual health clinics, with no apparent epidemiological links to endemic areas. We describe demographic and clinical characteristics of patients diagnosed with human monkeypox virus attending a sexual health centre.In this observational analysis, we considered patients with confirmed monkeypox virus infection via PCR detection attending open-access sexual health clinics in London, UK, between May 14 and May 25, 2022. We report hospital admissions and concurrent sexually transmitted infection (STI) proportions, and describe our local response within the first 2 weeks of the outbreak.Monkeypox virus infection was confirmed in 54 individuals, all identifying as men who have sex with men (MSM), with a median age of 41 years (IQR 34-45). 38 (70%) of 54 individuals were White, 26 (48%) were born in the UK, and 13 (24%) were living with HIV. 36 (67%) of 54 individuals reported fatigue or lethargy, 31 (57%) reported fever, and ten (18%) had no prodromal symptoms. All patients presented with skin lesions, of which 51 (94%) were anogenital. 37 (89%) of 54 individuals had skin lesions affecting more than one anatomical site and four (7%) had oropharyngeal lesions. 30 (55%) of 54 individuals had lymphadenopathy. One in four patients had a concurrent STI. Five (9%) of 54 individuals required admission to hospital, mainly due to pain or localised bacterial cellulitis requiring antibiotic intervention or analgesia. We recorded no fatal outcomes.Autochthonous community monkeypox virus transmission is currently observed among MSM in the UK. We found a high proportion of concomitant STIs and frequent anogenital symptoms, suggesting transmissibility through local inoculation during close skin-to-skin or mucosal contact, during sexual activity. Additional resources are required to support sexual health and other specialist services in managing this condition. A review of the case definition and better understanding of viral transmission routes are needed to shape infection control policies, education and prevention strategies, and contact tracing.None.", "The recent monkeypox disease outbreak is another significant threat during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This viral disease is zoonotic and contagious. The viral disease outbreak is considered the substantial infection possessed by the Orthopoxvirus family species after the smallpox virus' obliteration, a representative of the same family. It has potentially threatened the Republic of Congo's regions and certain African subcontinent zones. Although repeated outbreaks have been reported in several parts of the world, as conferred from the epidemiological data, very little is explored about the disease landscape. Thus, here we have reviewed the current status of the monkeypox virus along with therapeutic options available to humanity.We have accessed and reviewed the available literature on the monkeypox virus to highlight its epidemiology, pathogenicity, virulence, and therapeutic options available. For the review, we have searched different literature and database such as PubMed, PubMed Central, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, etc., using different keywords such as \"monkeypox\", \"Orthopox\", \"smallpox\", \"recent monkeypox outbreak\", \"therapeutic strategies\", \"monkeypox vaccines\", etc. This review has included most of the significant references from 1983 to 2022.It has been reported that the monkeypox virus shows a remarkable similarity with smallpox during the ongoing outbreak. Sometimes, it creates considerable confusion due to misdiagnosis and similarity with smallpox. The misdiagnosis of the disease should be immediately corrected by rendering some cutting-edge techniques especially intended to isolate the monkeypox virus. The pathophysiology and the histopathological data imply the immediate need to design effective therapeutics to confer resistance against the monkeypox virus. Most importantly, the potential implications of the disease are not given importance due to the lack of awareness programs. Moreover, specific evolutionary evidence is crucial for designing effective therapeutic strategies that confer high resistance, particularly against this species.The review focuses on a brief overview of the recent monkeypox virus outbreak, infection biology, epidemiology, transmission, clinical symptoms, and therapeutic aspects. Such an attempt will support researchers, policymakers, and healthcare professionals for better treatment and containment of the infection caused by the monkeypox virus.", "The human monkeypox infection has become the prevalent orthopoxviral disease in humans, and has developed challenging and threatening situations worldwide. This study is aimed at exploring the global epidemiological, biological and clinical characteristics of monkeypox from 1970 to July 1, 2022.Information about the monkeypox outbreak and its epidemiological and biological characteristics was obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports, Pub-Med, and Web of Science. Initially, these two leading international health organizations, and 10 documents were identified; after reviewing, we included WHO and CDC, and six documents in the analysis.Worldwide, from 1970 to July 1, 2022, the total number of confirmed and suspected cases of human monkeypox disease in endemic and non-endemic nations was 46,915. In endemic regions, the number of confirmed cases has been 2,805 and suspected cases have been 38,327, with a total number of 41,132. However, from May 7, 2022, to July 1, 2022, 5,783 monkeypox cases have been found in 52 non-endemic nations in Europe, the UK, the USA, Australia and the Middle East. The majority of cases have been found in the United Kingdom (1,235), Germany (1,054), Spain (800), France (498), United States (459), Portugal (402), Netherlands (288), Canada (287), Italy (192), Belgium (117), Switzerland (91), Israel (42), Ireland (39), Austria (37), Sweden (28), Brazil (21), and Denmark (20). The clinical presentation of monkeypox disease is mild symptoms, including headache, lymphadenopathy, body aches, severe weakness, and acute onset of fever above 38.5\u00b0C. A skin rash initiates as macules or papules, progresses to pustules and vesicles, ulcers, and ultimately transitions to crusted scabs. In a short period of about two months, the monkeypox cases swiftly spread in 52 non-endemic countries with an increased percentage worldwide.The geographic pattern of monkeypox disease spread is rapidly shifting from endemic to non-endemic regions. It now involves not only Africa but also Europe, the USA, the UK, Australia and the Middle East. The clinical characteristics of monkeypox infection are mostly mild symptoms, including headache, lymphadenopathy, body aches, severe weakness, and acute onset of fever above 38.5 degrees Centigrade. A skin rash originates as macules or papules, progresses to pustules and vesicles, ulcers, and eventually to crusted scabs. The regional and international health establishments must take priority preventive procedures to break the outbreaks of monkeypox disease across the globe. The physicians, healthcare workers, patients, and public education is of utmost importance to eradicate the disease.", "In May, 2022, several European countries reported autochthonous cases of monkeypox, which rapidly spread globally. Early reports suggest atypical presentations. We aimed to investigate clinical and virological characteristics of cases of human monkeypox in Spain.This multicentre, prospective, observational cohort study was done in three sexual health clinics in Madrid and Barcelona, Spain. We enrolled all consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed monkeypox from May 11 to June 29, 2022. Participants were offered lesion, anal, and oropharynx swabs for PCR testing. Participant data were collected by means of interviews conducted by dermatologists or specialists in sexually transmitted infections and were recorded using a standard case report form. Outcomes assessed in all participants with a confirmed diagnosis were demographics, smallpox vaccination, HIV status, exposure to someone with monkeypox, travel, mass gathering attendance, risk factors for sexually transmitted infections, sexual behaviour, signs and symptoms on first presentation, virological results at multiple body sites, co-infection with other sexually transmitted pathogens, and clinical outcomes 14 days after the initial presentation. Clinical outcomes were followed up until July 13, 2022.181 patients had a confirmed monkeypox diagnosis and were enrolled in the study. 166 (92%) identified as gay men, bisexual men, or other men who have sex with men (MSM) and 15 (8%) identified as heterosexual men or heterosexual women. Median age was 37\u00b70 years (IQR 31\u00b70-42\u00b70). 32 (18%) patients reported previous smallpox vaccination, 72 (40%) were HIV-positive, eight (11%) had a CD4 cell count less than 500 cells per \u03bcL, and 31 (17%) were diagnosed with a concurrent sexually transmitted infection. Median incubation was 7\u00b70 days (IQR 5\u00b70-10\u00b70). All participants presented with skin lesions; 141 (78%) participants had lesions in the anogenital region, and 78 (43%) in the oral and perioral region. 70 (39%) participants had complications requiring treatment: 45 (25%) had a proctitis, 19 (10%) had tonsillitis, 15 (8%) had penile oedema, six (3%) an abscess, and eight (4%) had an exanthem. Three (2%) patients required hospital admission. 178 (99%) of 180 swabs from skin lesions collected tested positive, as did 82 (70%) of 117 throat swabs. Viral load was higher in lesion swabs than in pharyngeal specimens (mean cycle threshold value 23 [SD 4] vs 32 [6], absolute difference 9 [95% CI 8-10]; p<0\u00b70001). 108 (65%) of 166 MSM reported anal-receptive sex. MSM who engaged in anal-receptive sex presented with proctitis (41 [38%] of 108 vs four [7%] of 58, absolute difference 31% [95% CI 19-44]; p<0\u00b70001) and systemic symptoms before the rash (67 [62%] vs 16 [28%], absolute difference 34% [28-62]; p<0\u00b70001) more frequently than MSM who did not engage in anal-receptive sex. 18 (95%) of 19 participants with tonsillitis reported practising oral-receptive sex. The median time from onset of lesions to formation of a dry crust was 10 days (IQR 7-13).In our cohort, monkeypox caused genital, perianal, and oral lesions and complications including proctitis and tonsillitis. Because of the variability of presentations, clinicians should have a low threshold for suspicion of monkeypox. Lesion swabs showed the highest viral loads, which, combined with the history of sexual exposure and the distribution of lesions, suggests close contact is probably the dominant transmission route in the current outbreak.None.", "Monkeypox virus, an orthopoxvirus sharing clinical features with smallpox virus, is endemic in several countries in Central and West Africa. The last reported outbreak in the United States, in 2003, was linked to contact with infected prairie dogs that had been housed or transported with African rodents imported from Ghana (1). Since May 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported a multinational outbreak of monkeypox centered in Europe and North America, with approximately 25,000 cases reported worldwide; the current outbreak is disproportionately affecting gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) (2). Monkeypox was declared a public health emergency in the United States on August 4, 2022.<sup>\u2020</sup> Available summary surveillance data from the European Union, England, and the United States indicate that among MSM patients with monkeypox for whom HIV status is known, 28%-51% have HIV infection (3-10). Treatment of monkeypox with tecovirimat as a first-line agent is available through CDC for compassionate use through an investigational drug protocol. No identified drug interactions would preclude coadministration of tecovirimat with antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV infection. Pre- and postexposure prophylaxis can be considered with JYNNEOS vaccine, if indicated. Although data are limited for monkeypox in patients with HIV, prompt diagnosis, treatment, and prevention might reduce the risk for adverse outcomes and limit monkeypox spread. Prevention and treatment considerations will be updated as more information becomes available.", "The biggest-ever outbreak of monkeypox disease in non-endemic countries started in May, 2022. Though no monkeypox case has been reported from India, till mid-June, 2022, yet, considering the rate of spread to the non-endemic countries, there is an urgent need of better understanding of the monkeypox virus and disease epidemiology to help clinicians, public health specialists, and policymakers to be prepared for any eventuality. This review summarises the monkeypox disease epidemiology, clinical features, therapies, vaccines and outlines the measures for preparedness and response for a possible outbreak. The disease is known to cause severe outcome in children, pregnant women, and immunocompromised hosts and this group need to be given special attention. The monkeypox disease outbreak (2022) in non-endemic countries should be used as an opportunity by India and other low and middle income countries to strengthen public health surveillance and health system capacity for outbreak and epidemic preparedness and response.", "Monkeypox was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 23 July 2022. Between 1 January and 23 July 2022, 16,016 laboratory confirmed cases of monkeypox and five deaths were reported to WHO from 75 countries on all continents. Public health authorities are proactively identifying cases and tracing their contacts to contain its spread. As with COVID-19, PCR is the only method capable of being deployed at sufficient speed to provide timely feedback on any public health interventions. However, at this point, there is little information on how those PCR assays are being standardised between laboratories. A likely reason is that testing is still limited on a global scale and that detection, not quantification, of monkeypox virus DNA is the main clinical requirement. Yet we should not be complacent about PCR performance. As testing requirements increase rapidly and specimens become more diverse, it would be prudent to ensure PCR accuracy from the outset to support harmonisation and ease regulatory conformance. Lessons from COVID-19 should aid implementation with appropriate material, documentary and methodological standards offering dynamic mechanisms to ensure testing that most accurately guides public health decisions.", "Recently, monkeypox has become a global concern amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Monkeypox is an acute rash zoonosis caused by the monkeypox virus, which was previously concentrated in Africa. The re-emergence of this pathogen seems unusual on account of outbreaks in multiple nonendemic countries and the incline to spread from person to person. We need to revisit this virus to prevent the epidemic from getting worse. In this review, we comprehensively summarize studies on monkeypox, including its epidemiology, biological characteristics, pathogenesis, and clinical characteristics, as well as therapeutics and vaccines, highlighting its unusual outbreak attributed to the transformation of transmission. We also analyze the present situation and put forward countermeasures from both clinical and scientific research to address it.", "Recently monkeypox cases have been reported from many non-endemic countries. The objective of this article is to bring out the epidemiology, mode of transmission, clinical features, genetic clades, and molecular properties of monkeypox virus.A detailed literature review was conducted on monkeypox, using databases PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, PMC and Cochrane Library, for the period between 1985 to 2022.Genetically monkeypox virus can be classified into Central African clade and Western African clades. The sequence similarity between the two strains was found to be 99.5%. However, some significant differences were found in the virulent and nonvirulent genes of the strains, such as BR-203, BR-209, COP-C3L b and COP-H5R, COP-A9L, COP-A50R, and COP-A36R, respectively. Human to human transmission occurs after exposure to respiratory droplets, oral secretions, contact with lesions, fomites, and direct/sexual contact. Monkeypox can also be transmitted from the infected mother to the fetus through the placenta leading to congenital infection. In May 2022 several cases have been reported from Europe, North America, and Australia, particularly from homosexual men.Monkeypox is a zoonotic disease which was prevalent in Central and Western African countries. Recently, human to human spread was noticed in developed countries of Europe, North America and Australia. Despite with a close genetic similarity between the two clades, the Central African strain is comparatively very virulent with high mortality. Monkeypox should be considered a re-emerging, neglected disease and proper measures like hand hygiene, wearing masks and vaccination to the high-risk groups are advised.", "Before April 2022, monkeypox virus infection in humans was seldom reported outside African regions where it is endemic. Currently, cases are occurring worldwide. Transmission, risk factors, clinical presentation, and outcomes of infection are poorly defined.We formed an international collaborative group of clinicians who contributed to an international case series to describe the presentation, clinical course, and outcomes of polymerase-chain-reaction-confirmed monkeypox virus infections.We report 528 infections diagnosed between April 27 and June 24, 2022, at 43 sites in 16 countries. Overall, 98% of the persons with infection were gay or bisexual men, 75% were White, and 41% had human immunodeficiency virus infection; the median age was 38 years. Transmission was suspected to have occurred through sexual activity in 95% of the persons with infection. In this case series, 95% of the persons presented with a rash (with 64% having \u226410 lesions), 73% had anogenital lesions, and 41% had mucosal lesions (with 54 having a single genital lesion). Common systemic features preceding the rash included fever (62%), lethargy (41%), myalgia (31%), and headache (27%); lymphadenopathy was also common (reported in 56%). Concomitant sexually transmitted infections were reported in 109 of 377 persons (29%) who were tested. Among the 23 persons with a clear exposure history, the median incubation period was 7 days (range, 3 to 20). Monkeypox virus DNA was detected in 29 of the 32 persons in whom seminal fluid was analyzed. Antiviral treatment was given to 5% of the persons overall, and 70 (13%) were hospitalized; the reasons for hospitalization were pain management, mostly for severe anorectal pain (21 persons); soft-tissue superinfection (18); pharyngitis limiting oral intake (5); eye lesions (2); acute kidney injury (2); myocarditis (2); and infection-control purposes (13). No deaths were reported.In this case series, monkeypox manifested with a variety of dermatologic and systemic clinical findings. The simultaneous identification of cases outside areas where monkeypox has traditionally been endemic highlights the need for rapid identification and diagnosis of cases to contain further community spread.", "Public health authorities recommend symptom monitoring of healthcare personnel (HCP) after defined exposures to monkeypox. We report on the rapid development and implementation of mobile responsive survey solutions for notification of possible exposure, exposure risk assessment and stratification, and symptom monitoring.An academic health center in Boston, Massachusetts, after admission of first diagnosed case of monkeypox in the United States during the current global outbreak.Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) design and programmers, infection control, occupational health, and emergency preparedness specialists, and HCP with possible exposure to monkeypox.Design and deployment of REDCap tools to identify HCP with possible exposure to monkeypox, to perform exposure risk assessment and stratification for postexposure prophylaxis (PEP), and to conduct symptom monitoring during the exposure window. Project enhancements included dashboards for HCP tracking and short message service (SMS text) reminders for symptom monitoring.Tools to support the contact tracing and exposure investigation were deployed within 24 hours of identification of a patient with suspected monkeypox, with the full suite in production within 4 days of confirmation of the monkeypox diagnosis. Clinical follow-up of HCP was integrated into the design, and real-time versioning allowed for improvements in HCP symptom monitoring compliance and enhanced tracking.During the current monkeypox outbreak, timely and comprehensive evaluation of potential HCP exposures is necessary but presents logistical challenges. Rapid development of monkeypox-specific solutions using REDCap facilitated flexibility in design and approach, and integration of targeted clinical support enhanced functionality.", "Cases of human monkeypox are rarely seen outside of west and central Africa. There are few data regarding viral kinetics or the duration of viral shedding and no licensed treatments. Two oral drugs, brincidofovir and tecovirimat, have been approved for treatment of smallpox and have demonstrated efficacy against monkeypox in animals. Our aim was to describe the longitudinal clinical course of monkeypox in a high-income setting, coupled with viral dynamics, and any adverse events related to novel antiviral therapies.In this retrospective observational study, we report the clinical features, longitudinal virological findings, and response to off-label antivirals in seven patients with monkeypox who were diagnosed in the UK between 2018 and 2021, identified through retrospective case-note review. This study included all patients who were managed in dedicated high consequence infectious diseases (HCID) centres in Liverpool, London, and Newcastle, coordinated via a national HCID network.We reviewed all cases since the inception of the HCID (airborne) network between Aug 15, 2018, and Sept 10, 2021, identifying seven patients. Of the seven patients, four were men and three were women. Three acquired monkeypox in the UK: one patient was a health-care worker who acquired the virus nosocomially, and one patient who acquired the virus abroad transmitted it to an adult and child within their household cluster. Notable disease features included viraemia, prolonged monkeypox virus DNA detection in upper respiratory tract swabs, reactive low mood, and one patient had a monkeypox virus PCR-positive deep tissue abscess. Five patients spent more than 3 weeks (range 22-39 days) in isolation due to prolonged PCR positivity. Three patients were treated with brincidofovir (200 mg once a week orally), all of whom developed elevated liver enzymes resulting in cessation of therapy. One patient was treated with tecovirimat (600 mg twice daily for 2 weeks orally), experienced no adverse effects, and had a shorter duration of viral shedding and illness (10 days hospitalisation) compared with the other six patients. One patient experienced a mild relapse 6 weeks after hospital discharge.Human monkeypox poses unique challenges, even to well resourced health-care systems with HCID networks. Prolonged upper respiratory tract viral DNA shedding after skin lesion resolution challenged current infection prevention and control guidance. There is an urgent need for prospective studies of antivirals for this disease.None.", "Monkeypox is an emerging epidemic of concern. The disease is caused by the monkeypox virus and an increasing global incidence with a 2022 outbreak that has spread to Europe amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The new outbreak is associated with novel, previously undiscovered mutations and variants. Currently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved poxvirus treatment involves the use of tecovirimat. However, there is otherwise limited pharmacopoeia and research interest in monkeypox. In this study, virtual screening and molecular dynamics were employed to explore the potential repurposing of multiple drugs previously approved by the FDA or other jurisdictions for other applications. Several drugs are predicted to tightly bind to viral proteins, which are crucial in viral replication, including molecules which show high potential for binding the monkeypox D13L capsid protein, whose inhibition has previously been demonstrated to suppress viral replication.", "Monkeypox (MPX), is a rare endemic zoonotic disease of certain areas of Central and West Africa. Nevertheless, in recent years, several outbreaks have occurred outside the African continent. Monkeypox usually presents with a flu-like prodromal period (fever, headache, chills, sweating) associated or followed by the appearance of lymphadenopathy and a typical skin rash. Transmission is suspected to be direct or indirect via contact with saliva, respiratory droplets or skin lesions of infected animals or more rarely of humans. The gold standard for diagnosis is the detection of MPX virus (MPXV) by PCR on skin lesion fluid. The evolution is usually favourable in 2 to 5 weeks but severe complications and sequelae are possible. In the absence of a specific treatment, the management is essentially supportive: appropriate local care, rehydration, analgesia and management of eventual complications.", "Monkeypox is a rare infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus, which used to occur endemically in central and western Africa. As of 25th May, a total of 219 recently confirmed cases of monkeypox have been reported from 19 non-endemic countries. This outbreak unusually takes place in non-endemic areas for monkeypox virus and has exhibited features of high risk of human-to-human transmission. Onset of multiple human monkeypox cases may be related to the decreased level of herd cross-immunity after the cessation of smallpox vaccination. Moreover, behavioral patterns in specific populations may account for the human-to-human transmission in this outbreak. Currently, possibility of global epidemic of monkeypox is extremely low, but China should be cautious about risks of importation of monkeypox cases. The key to prevention and control is to establish a surveillance system to identify suspicious cases and close contacts as soon as possible.", "Monkeypox has a very prominent regional epidemic. It has been confined to Western and Central African countries. Sporadic cases found in countries outside Africa generally have a history of sojourn in endemic areas. However, the recent multinational outbreak of monkeypox cases in Europe in early May 2022 has revealed a changing epidemiological trend, those confirmed cases had no sojourn history in endemic areas and with a high proportion of cases involving men who have sex with men (MSM). Among the MSM cases, many of them presented atypical clinical manifestations of monkeypox and with other sexually transmitted diseases co-infection. Combined with the high social interactivity in this community, there is likely a higher risk of monkeypox transmission in this population. Establishing an infectious disease surveillance system, maintaining highly vigilant regarding the transmission of monkeypox in MSM, and responding promptly are necessary and effective measures to contain the outbreak.", "By 22 June 2022, 521 cases of monkeypox were notified in Germany. The median age was 38 years (IQR: 32-44); all cases were men. In Berlin, where 69% of all cases occurred, almost all were men who have sex with men. Monkeypox virus likely circulated unrecognised in Berlin before early May. Since mid-May, we observed a shift from travel-associated infections to mainly autochthonous transmission that predominantly took place in Berlin, often in association with visits to clubs and parties.", "In May 2022, monkeypox outbreaks have been reported in countries not endemic for monkeypox. We estimated the monkeypox incubation period, using reported exposure and symptom-onset times for 18 cases detected and confirmed in the Netherlands up to 31 May 2022. Mean incubation period was 8.5\u2009days (5th-95th percentiles: 4.2-17.3), underpinning the current recommendation to monitor or isolate/quarantine case contacts for 21\u2009days. However, as the incubation period may differ between different transmission routes, further epidemiological investigations are needed.", "A case of monkeypox was diagnosed in a returning traveler from Nigeria to Maryland, USA. Prompt infection control measures led to no secondary cases in 40 exposed healthcare workers. Given the global health implications, public health systems should be aware of effective strategies to mitigate the potential spread of monkeypox.", "The largest West African monkeypox outbreak began September 2017, in Nigeria. Four individuals traveling from Nigeria to the United Kingdom (n = 2), Israel (n = 1), and Singapore (n = 1) became the first human monkeypox cases exported from Africa, and a related nosocomial transmission event in the United Kingdom became the first confirmed human-to-human monkeypox transmission event outside of Africa.Epidemiological and molecular data for exported and Nigerian cases were analyzed jointly to better understand the exportations in the temporal and geographic context of the outbreak.Isolates from all travelers and a Bayelsa case shared a most recent common ancestor and traveled to Bayelsa, Delta, or Rivers states. Genetic variation for this cluster was lower than would be expected from a random sampling of genomes from this outbreak, but data did not support direct links between travelers.Monophyly of exportation cases and the Bayelsa sample, along with the intermediate levels of genetic variation, suggest a small pool of related isolates is the likely source for the exported infections. This may be the result of the level of genetic variation present in monkeypox isolates circulating within the contiguous region of Bayelsa, Delta, and Rivers states, or another more restricted, yet unidentified source pool.", "Monkeypox is a poorly described emerging zoonosis endemic to Central and Western Africa.Using surveillance data from Tshuapa Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo during 2011-2015, we evaluated differences in incidence, exposures, and clinical presentation of polymerase chain reaction-confirmed cases by sex and age.We report 1057 confirmed cases. The average annual incidence was 14.1 per 100 000 (95% confidence interval, 13.3-15.0). The incidence was higher in male patients (incidence rate ratio comparing males to females, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.37), except among those 20-29 years old (0.70; .51-.95). Females aged 20-29 years also reported a high frequency of exposures (26.2%) to people with monkeypox-like symptoms.The highest incidence was among 10-19-year-old males, the cohort reporting the highest proportion of animal exposures (37.5%). The incidence was lower among those presumed to have received smallpox vaccination than among those presumed unvaccinated. No differences were observed by age group in lesion count or lesion severity score.Monkeypox incidence was twice that reported during 1980-1985, an increase possibly linked to declining immunity provided by smallpox vaccination. The high proportion of cases attributed to human exposures suggests changing exposure patterns. Cases were distributed across age and sex, suggesting frequent exposures that follow sociocultural norms.", "Monkeypox, a zoonotic disease caused by an orthopoxvirus, results in a smallpox-like disease in humans. Since monkeypox in humans was initially diagnosed in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), it has spread to other regions of Africa (primarily West and Central), and cases outside Africa have emerged in recent years. We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed and grey literature on how monkeypox epidemiology has evolved, with particular emphasis on the number of confirmed, probable, and/or possible cases, age at presentation, mortality, and geographical spread. The review is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020208269). We identified 48 peer-reviewed articles and 18 grey literature sources for data extraction. The number of human monkeypox cases has been on the rise since the 1970s, with the most dramatic increases occurring in the DRC. The median age at presentation has increased from 4 (1970s) to 21 years (2010-2019). There was an overall case fatality rate of 8.7%, with a significant difference between clades-Central African 10.6% (95% CI: 8.4%- 13.3%) vs. West African 3.6% (95% CI: 1.7%- 6.8%). Since 2003, import- and travel-related spread outside of Africa has occasionally resulted in outbreaks. Interactions/activities with infected animals or individuals are risk behaviors associated with acquiring monkeypox. Our review shows an escalation of monkeypox cases, especially in the highly endemic DRC, a spread to other countries, and a growing median age from young children to young adults. These findings may be related to the cessation of smallpox vaccination, which provided some cross-protection against monkeypox, leading to increased human-to-human transmission. The appearance of outbreaks beyond Africa highlights the global relevance of the disease. Increased surveillance and detection of monkeypox cases are essential tools for understanding the continuously changing epidemiology of this resurging disease.", "To analyse the transmission dynamics of the monkeypox outbreak in the UK, declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in July 2022.Contact tracing study, linking data on case-contact pairs and on probable exposure dates.Case questionnaires from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), United Kingdom.2746 people with polymerase chain reaction confirmed monkeypox virus in the UK between 6 May and 1 August 2022.The incubation period and serial interval of a monkeypox infection using two bayesian time delay models-one corrected for interval censoring (ICC-interval censoring corrected) and one corrected for interval censoring, right truncation, and epidemic phase bias (ICRTC-interval censoring right truncation corrected). Growth rates of cases by reporting date, when monkeypox virus was confirmed and reported to UKHSA, were estimated using generalised additive models.The mean age of participants was 37.8 years and 95% reported being gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (1160 out of 1213 reporting). The mean incubation period was estimated to be 7.6 days (95% credible interval 6.5 to 9.9) using the ICC model and 7.8 days (6.6 to 9.2) using the ICRTC model. The estimated mean serial interval was 8.0 days (95% credible interval 6.5 to 9.8) using the ICC model and 9.5 days (7.4 to 12.3) using the ICRTC model. Although the mean serial interval was longer than the incubation period for both models, short serial intervals were more common than short incubation periods, with the 25th centile and the median of the serial interval shorter than the incubation period. For the ICC and ICRTC models, the corresponding estimates ranged from 1.8 days (95% credible interval 1.5 to 1.8) to 1.6 days (1.4 to 1.6) shorter at the 25th centile and 1.6 days (1.5 to 1.7) to 0.8 days (0.3 to 1.2) shorter at the median. 10 out of 13 linked patients had documented pre-symptomatic transmission. Doubling times of cases declined from 9.07 days (95% confidence interval 12.63 to 7.08) on the 6 May, when the first case of monkeypox was reported in the UK, to a halving time of 29 days (95% confidence interval 38.02 to 23.44) on 1 August.Analysis of the instantaneous growth rate of monkeypox incidence indicates that the epidemic peaked in the UK as of 9 July and then started to decline. Short serial intervals were more common than short incubation periods suggesting considerable pre-symptomatic transmission, which was validated through linked patient level records. For patients who could be linked through personally identifiable data, four days was the maximum time that transmission was detected before symptoms manifested. An isolation period of 16 to 23 days would be required to detect 95% of people with a potential infection. The 95th centile of the serial interval was between 23 and 41 days, suggesting long infectious periods.", "Monkeypox is an <i>Orthopoxvirus</i>, endemic to West Africa and the Congo Basin. It causes an illness characterized by fever, myalgias, lymphadenopathy, and a disseminated vesicular rash. Although similar to smallpox, monkeypox is typically milder, with a lower mortality rate. Endemicity in Africa was previously reduced owing to cross-protection from smallpox vaccine but has been increasing since cessation of universal vaccination. Sporadic cases have been imported to the United States (US), with a few secondary cases. A large global outbreak in 2022 has demonstrated changing epidemiology and increased person-to-person transmission. In May 2022, a returned traveler in Massachusetts presented with monkeypox. As of October 7, 2022, 71,096 cases had been reported in 107 countries, and 26,577 of those were in the US. Most cases have been in younger people without previous smallpox vaccination and in men who have sex with men, a previously unrecognized mode of transmission. <b>[<i>Pediatr Ann</i>. 2022;51(11):e431-e435.]</b>.", "Monkeypox has recently been described as a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization and a public health emergency by the United States. If the outbreak continues to grow, rapid scalability of laboratory testing will be imperative. During the early days of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, laboratories improved the scalability of testing by using a direct-to-PCR approach. To improve the scalability of monkeypox testing, a direct real-time PCR protocol for the detection of monkeypox virus was validated. The assay retains the sensitivity and accuracy of the indirect assay while eliminating the need for nucleic acid extraction kits, reducing laboratory technologist time per sample and decreasing exposure to an infectious agent. The direct method will make it easier for laboratories across the world to rapidly develop, validate, and scale testing for monkeypox virus.", "The World Health Organization, has declared the recent multiregional outbreak of monkeypox, a global public health emergency. Monkeypox is a zoonotic viral infection endemic to the west and central Africa. It belongs to the Poxviridae family, the Chordopoxvirinae subfamily, and the Orthopoxvirus genus. The Poxviridae family generally consists of complex, large, enveloped, and linear double-stranded DNA viruses. The initial clinical symptoms of monkeypox are often fever, severe headache, lymphadenopathy, myalgia, and fatigue. The skin lesions typically erupt within 1-3 days of the onset of fever. The rash tends to be more localized on the face and extremities than on the trunk. Monkeypox is often a self-limiting infection, and symptoms last from 2 to 4 weeks. It is isolated from various species, but the exact natural host is uncertain. Monkeypox is transmitted by close contact with infected humans or animals. Currently, no specific medication is available for monkeypox, and the existing therapeutics are the anti-viral agents approved for smallpox infection, including tecovirimat, cidofovir, and brincidofovir. Additionally, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Vaccinia Immune Globulin Intravenous for treating vaccination complications. It is diagnosed by PCR. There are currently two vaccines licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. According to the WHO guidance, the first-generation smallpox vaccines held in national reserves of some countries are not recommended as they do not meet the current safety and manufacturing standards. The interim guidance indicates that new and safer (second- and third generation) vaccines for smallpox, may be beneficial for monkeypox prevention, including JYNNEOS, which has been approved for the prevention of monkeypox. Human monkeypox was first reported in 1970. Since then, it has caused several outbreaks, mainly in central and west Africa. The first monkeypox outbreak outside of Africa occurred in the United States in 2003, linked to contact with infected pet prairie dogs. More recently (2018-2021), monkeypox cases have been reported in travelers from Nigeria to the United Kingdom, Israel, Singapore, and the US. Since May 2022, multiple monkeypox cases have been confirmed in several non-endemic countries, raising the concern of an emerging global pandemic. This review is an updated overview of our current state of knowledge regarding monkeypox virology, pathophysiology, clinical characteristics, epidemiology, vaccines, diagnosis, and treatment options.", "Smallpox eradication, coordinated by the WHO and certified 40\u00a0years ago, led to the cessation of routine smallpox vaccination in most countries. It is estimated that over 70% of the world's population is no longer protected against smallpox, and through cross-immunity, to closely related orthopox viruses such as monkeypox. Monkeypox is now a re-emerging disease. Monkeypox is endemic in as yet unconfirmed animal reservoirs in sub-Saharan Africa, while its human epidemiology appears to be changing. Monkeypox in small animals imported from Ghana as exotic pets was at the origin of an outbreak of human monkeypox in the USA in 2003. Travellers infected in Nigeria were at the origin of monkeypox cases in the UK in 2018 and 2019, Israel in 2018 and Singapore in2019. Together with sporadic reports of human infections with other orthopox viruses, these facts invite speculation that emergent or re-emergent human monkeypox might fill the epidemiological niche vacated by smallpox. An ad-hoc and unofficial group of interested experts met to consider these issues at Chatham House, London in June 2019, in order to review available data and identify monkeypox-related research gaps. Gaps identified by the experts included:The experts further agreed on the need for a better understanding of the genomic evolution and changing epidemiology of orthopox viruses, the usefulness of in-field genomic diagnostics, and the best disease control strategies, including the possibility of vaccination with new generation non-replicating smallpox vaccines and treatment with recently developed antivirals.", "The emergence of monkeypox has presented a new challenge for health agencies around the globe. There is significant increase in the number of cases that too in non-endemic countries with more than 18000 cases reported worldwide.The present study was conducted to assess knowledge and awareness regarding monkeypox among dental professionals.The present cross-sectional study among 410 subjects who were residing in a northern state of the country. Informed consent was obtained from all the subjects. Study sample was selected on the basis of Systematic random sampling methodology. A self-designed close-ended questionnaire written in English and verified by experts was utilized for the study. The questionnaire was delivered personally to study subjects to collect the required information. Chi-square test and ANOVA were used for statistical analysis.One-fourth (24.8%) of the subjects never heard about monkeypox disease. Negative response was given by 44.8% of subjects regarding resemblance of monkeypox with small pox. Only 31.2% of subjects had knowledge regarding oral manifestations of the disease. High knowledge scores were reported by only 28% of subjects. Higher knowledge levels were significantly related to education level and working profile of study subjects. Online media (Internet) was preferred as the main source to obtain more information by 42.2 of subjects.There was low level of knowledge regarding monkeypox among study subjects. There is an urgent need for dental professionals to keep themselves updated with recent knowledge on new emerging infectious diseases.", "Monkeypox disease is a zoonosis that has the monkey virus (MPXV) as its etiologic agent, an enveloped double-stranded DNA virus that has caused some severe cases, leading to 3-6% fatality ratio. MPXV exhibits similar symptoms to those observed for Smallpox infection. Human-to-human transmission occurs via droplet respiratory particles and close contact with skin lesions of an infected person or recently contaminated objects. MPXV symptoms include fever, intense headache, back pain, myalgia, severe asthenia, lymphadenopathy, and skin eruption. The 2022 outbreak is growing, spreading over 75 countries/territories. Based on this, the MPXV outbreak was declared a \"public health emergency of international concern\" by WHO. In 2019, a vaccine-based modified attenuated vaccinia virus (Ankara strain) was approved for MPXV prevention. However, its availability remains limited. Besides, there are no approved or licensed drugs to treat MPXV currently. However, tecovirimat was licensed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to treat MPXV infections. Notwithstanding all these aspects and limitations associated with MPXV, How the medicinal chemistry could help us?", "The human monkeypox is an emerging zoonotic orthopoxvirus with a clinical presentation similar to that of smallpox. It is difficult to differentiate monkeypox from other orthopedic infections, and laboratory diagnosis is the primary component of disease identification and monitoring. However, current diagnostics are time-consuming, and new tests are needed for rapid and precise diagnosis. Most cases have been reported in Central Africa; however, an increasing number of cases have been reported in Europe, the United States of America (USA), Australia, and the United Arab Emirates. Although investigation of the current global outbreak is still ongoing, viral transmission seems to have occurred during crowded events in Spain and Belgium. New therapeutics and vaccines are being deployed for the treatment and prevention of monkeypox, and more research on the epidemiology, biology, and ecology of the virus in endemic areas is required to understand and prevent further global outbreaks.", "Monkeypox virus, a member of the\u00a0Orthopoxvirus\u00a0genus, was first identified as the etiology of monkeypox in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and remains endemic in regions of Central and West Africa. Following the most recent outbreak of monkeypox in multiple countries throughout Europe and North America, the infection has been declared a public health emergency by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Within this report, we aim to provide clinicians with a focused overview of the epidemiology, clinical manifestation, diagnosis, and approaches to treat and prevent monkeypox infection amidst the global outbreak.", "Monkeypox is a global health emergency. Prior to 2022, there were few reports of monkeypox outside of endemic countries, which were mostly travel-related. Since May 2022, an exponential increase in monkeypox infections in previously non-endemic countries has been reported. Unlike previous outbreaks of monkeypox, which were zoonotically transmitted and presented with generalised vesicular eruptions after prodromal symptoms, cases of the current outbreak feature significant travel and sexual history, and atypical localised genital eruptions with unpredictable onset relative to viral prodrome-like symptoms. We summarise the 15 Singapore cases reported to date as of August 2022, and highlight salient clinical clues that may aid physicians in narrowing the broad differential diagnosis of an acute vesicular genital eruption. Although research into vaccination and antiviral strategies is ongoing, monkeypox is currently conservatively managed. Clinical vigilance and a high index of suspicion are required to facilitate early detection and isolation of cases to contain transmission in Singapore.", "We report a case of monkeypox in the United States in a patient who had been vaccinated with ACAM2000 smallpox vaccine 8 years earlier. Despite his vaccination status, he still contracted disease. He showed prodromal symptoms preceding development of painless penile lesions that later coalesced.", "A previously healthy male patient had detectable monkeypox virus DNA in saliva 76 days after laboratory confirmation of infection. A comprehensive characterization of viral kinetics and a detailed follow-up indicated a declining risk for transmission during the weeks after monkeypox symptoms appeared.", "In July 2021, we conducted environmental sampling at the residence of a person in Dallas, Texas, USA, who had travel-associated human West African monkeypox virus (MPXV-WA). Targeted environmental swab sampling was conducted 15 days after the person who had monkeypox left the household. Results indicate extensive MPXV-WA DNA contamination, and viable virus from 7 samples was successfully isolated in cell culture. There was no statistical difference (p = 0.94) between MPXV-WA PCR positivity of porous (9/10, 90%) vs. nonporous (19/21, 90.5%) surfaces, but there was a significant difference (p<0.01) between viable virus detected in cultures of porous (6/10, 60%) vs. nonporous (1/21, 5%) surfaces. These findings indicate that porous surfaces (e.g., bedding, clothing) may pose more of a MPXV exposure risk than nonporous surfaces (e.g., metal, plastic). Viable MPXV was detected on household surfaces after at least 15 days. However, low titers (<10<sup>2</sup> PFU) indicate a limited potential for indirect transmission.", "The infectious disease human monkeypox is spreading rapidly in 2022, causing a\u00a0global health crisis. The genomics of Monkeypox virus (MPXV) have been extensively analyzed and reported, although little is known about the virus-encoded proteome. In particular, there are no reported experimental MPXV protein structures other than computational models. Here, a 1.52\u2005\u00c5 resolution X-ray structure of the MPXV protein A42R, the first MPXV-encoded protein with a known structure, is reported. A42R shows structural similarity to profilins, which are cellular proteins that are known to function in the regulation of actin cytoskeletal assembly. However, structural comparison of A42R with known members of the profilin family reveals critical differences that support prior biochemical findings that A42R only weakly binds actin and does not bind poly(L-proline). In addition, the analysis suggests that A42R may make distinct interactions with phosphatidylinositol lipids. Overall, the data suggest that the role of A42R in the replication of orthopoxviruses may not be readily determined by comparison to cellular profilins. Furthermore, these findings support the need for increased efforts to determine high-resolution structures of other MPXV proteins to inform physiological studies of the poxvirus infection cycle and to reveal potential new strategies to combat human monkeypox should this emerging infectious disease with pandemic potential become more common in the future.", "Human monkeypox (MPX) is an endemic zoonotic disease in regions of Africa caused by the monkeypox virus, with recent outbreaks in several non-African countries. In this study, we present two cases of patients with MPX infection complicated by a deep skin infection. Both patients presented to our dermatology clinic with a clinical syndrome characteristic of MPX. The diagnosis was confirmed based on swabs of skin lesions. Both patients later returned to our clinic with erythema, pain, and edema at the site of previous papules and were diagnosed with deep skin bacterial infection. In this study we provide information on what we believe was an underreported MPX infection complication and give some advice on preventing cases of cellulitis in these patients.", "Monkeypox is the most prevalent Orthopoxvirus zoonosis infection since the eradication of smallpox. The current multi-country outbreak involves five WHO regions affecting mainly Europe. Accurate clinical and virological aspects of the disease outside endemic areas are needed.We performed an observational study of cases diagnosed in Madrid (Spain) (May/June 2022). Confirmation from vesicular lesions swabs, Orthopoxvirus real-time PCR, sequencing, phylogenetic analysis, and direct detection by Electron microscopy was performed. In addition, a structured epidemiological questionnaire was completed systematically to gather sociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral data from all confirmed cases.We extracted data from 48 patients, all cisgender men. The median age was 35 years (IQR 29 - 44), and 87.5% were MSM. The most prevalent symptoms were the presence of vesicular-umbilicated and pseudo-pustular skin lesions (93.8%), asthenia (66.6%), and fever (52.1%). In addition, the location of the lesions in the genital or perianal area was related to the role in sexual intercourse (p<0.001). Sequencing analysis indicated the virus circulating in Spain belongs to the western African clade. Like the other European cases in the outbreak, the Spanish isolates are a direct descendant of viruses previously detected in Nigeria, the UK, Singapore, and Israel in 2017-2018.Monkeypox is an emerging infectious disease in Europe where community transmission is reported, mainly in MSM. The first symptom was skin lesions instead of classical fever and rash. The disease follows a self-limited course, and there have been no cases with a serious presentation or severe complications.", "We report results of surveillance between June and mid-September 2022 of pet animals living in households of confirmed human monkeypox (MPX) cases. Since surveillance commenced, 154 animals from 40 households with a confirmed human MPX case were reported to the United Kingdom Animal and Plant Health Agency. No animals with clinical signs of MPX were identified. While a risk of transmission exists to pets from owners with a confirmed MPX virus infection, we assess this risk to be low.", "Human monkeypox (MPX) is a neglected zoonotic disease caused by the MPX virus a double-stranded DNA virus which belongs to the Poxviridae family genus Orthopoxvirus. It is endemic in the rural rainforests of Central and Western Africa where it is responsible of human sporadic cases and outbreaks since 1970. Outside Africa MPXV caused an outbreak in 2003 in the United States linked to importation of infected rodents from Ghana and a few travel-related cases in the USA, United Kingdom, Israel and Singapore. Actually, a worldwide outbreak with more than 1200 confirmed cases mainly concentrated among men who have sex with men is ongoing.We present the case of an Italian man living in Portugal that was diagnosed with MPX at our clinic in Milan, Italy. Monkeypox virus infection was confirmed by a specific homemade Real-Time PCR. Samples obtained from different sites (pharynx, skin lesions, anal ulcer, seminal fluid) turned all positive with different viral load.Our report illustrates the challenge of a disease that seems to present in a different way from classic description with possible human-to-human transmission through sexual contact.", "Monkeypox is a zoonotic disease caused by monkeypox virus (MPXV), in which outbreaks mainly occurred in West and Central Africa, with only sporadic spillovers to countries outside Africa due to international travel or close contact with wildlife. During May 2022, multiple countries in Europe, North and South America, Australia, Asia, and Africa reported near-simultaneous outbreaks of MPXV, the first time that patient clusters were reported over such a large geographical area. Cases have no known epidemiological links to MPXV-endemic countries in West or Central Africa. Real-time PCR is currently the gold standard for MPXV diagnostics, but it requires trained laboratory personnel and specialized equipment, and results can only be obtained after several hours. A rapid and simple-to-operate point-of-care diagnostic test for MPXV is crucial for limiting its spread and controlling outbreaks. Here, three recombinase-based isothermal amplification assays (RPA/RAA) for the rapid detection of MPXV isolates were developed. These three assays target the MPXV G2R gene, and the limit of detection for these systems is approximately 10<sup>0</sup> copies of DNA per reaction. The assays were found to be specific and non-cross reactive against other pox viruses, such as vaccinia virus, and the results can be visualized within 20-30 min. The assays were validated with DNA extracted from 19 clinical samples from suspected or confirmed MPXV patients from Central Africa, and found to be consistent with findings from traditional qPCR. These results provide a solid platform for the early diagnosis of potential MPXV cases, and will help with the control and prevention of current and future outbreaks.", "The current monkeypox virus global spread and lack of data regarding clinical specimens' infectivity call for examining virus infectivity, and whether this correlates with results from PCR, the available diagnostic tool. We show strong correlation between viral DNA amount in clinical specimens and virus infectivity toward BSC-1 cell line. Moreover, we define a PCR threshold value (Cq\u2009\u2265\u200935, \u2264\u20094,300 DNA copies/mL), corresponding to negative viral cultures, which may assist risk-assessment and decision-making regarding protective-measures and guidelines for patients with monkeypox.", "Human monkeypox (MPX) is a rare zoonotic infection characterized by smallpox-like signs and symptoms. It is caused by monkeypox virus (MPXV), a double stranded DNA virus belonging to the genus Orthopoxvirus. MPX was first identified in 1970 and mostly prevailed in the rural rainforests of Central and West Africa in the past. Outside Africa, MPX was reported in the United Kingdom, the USA, Israel, and Singapore. In 2022, the resurgence of MPX in Europe and elsewhere posed a potential threat to humans. MPXV was transmitted by the animals-human or human-human pathway, and the symptoms of MPXV infection are similar to that of smallpox, but in a milder form and with lower mortality (1%-10%). Although the smallpox vaccination has been shown to provide 85% protection against MPXV infection, and two anti-smallpox virus drugs have been approved to treat MPXV, there are still no specific vaccines and drugs against MPXV infection. Therefore it is urgent to take active measures including the adoption of novel anti-MPXV strategies to control the spread of MPXV and prevent MPX epidemic. In this review, we summarize the biological features, epidemiology, pathogenicity, laboratory diagnosis, and prevention and treatment strategies on MPXV. This review provides the basic knowledge for prevention and control of future outbreaks of this emerging infection.", "The Monkeypox virus belongs to the Orthopoxvius genus, as does the specifically human smallpox virus. It is zoonotic and had never previously been considered as capable of human-to-human transmission over more than nine viral generation cycles. While relevant animal reservoirs have yet to be identified, non-human primates (NHP) are only accidental hosts. The potentially high number of current human shedders during the clinical phase (3 weeks maximum) raises the question of a risk in our countries of animals being contaminated by infected humans (reverse zoonosis). Cats as well as cows are susceptible to the Cowpox virus, another zoonotic Orthopoxvirus, which they transmit to humans. Dogs are much less susceptible to this virus and seem only receptive to Vaccinia virus (also belonging to the Orthopoxvirus genus). On the other hand, one study has demonstrated the pronounced susceptibility of the adult albino rabbit and of young animals of several rodent species to Monkeypox virus (MPXV). Given the susceptibility to MPXV of prairie dogs, which are American Sciuridae, the potential for infection of European squirrels cannot be ruled out.", "In the late 1970s, global vaccination programs resulted in the eradication of smallpox. The Monkeypox virus (MPXV), which is closely related to the smallpox-inducing variola virus, was previously endemic only in Sub-Saharan Africa but is currently spreading worldwide. Only older people who have been vaccinated against smallpox are expected to be sufficiently protected against poxviruses. Here I will summarize current knowledge about the virus, the disease caused by MPXV infections, and strategies to limit its spread."]
